e armed forces in norway. 74
    libraries serve the norwegian armed forces. welfare services
    are an integral part of the general care and administration of
    defence personnel and the library service is a section of the
    defence welfare service. the larger libraries stock around
    5,000 volumes, while the smaller ones have 900-1,000. in recent
    years all 74 libraries have received the same new books, in
    order to provide the same selection to each unit and some
    libraries have begun to provide music collections.</text>

    greenwood (1851-1908) was born into poverty and hardship; made
    the most of his education by reading extensively and later
    attending a mutual improvement society; and eventually became a
    successful publisher of technical books and periodicals.
    wishing to help others make the best of their lives, his main
    preoccupation was with public libraries because in them he
    discovered an educational institution which reflected many of
    his own ideals. for much of his life, he gave unsparingly his

    <text>analysis of the pff replacement algorithm via a
    semi-markov model an analytical model is presented to estimate
    the performance of the page fault frequency (pff) replacement
    algorithm. in this model, program behavior is represented by
    the lru stack distance model and the pff replacement algorithm
    is represented by a semi-markov model. using these models, such
    parameters as the inter-page-fault interval distribution, the
    probability of the number of distinct pages being referenced
    during an inter-page-fault interval, etc. are able to be
    analytically determined. using these models to evaluate these
    parameter values permits study of the performance of the
    replacement algorithm by simulating the page fault events
    rather than every page reference event. this significantly
    reduces the required computation time in estimating the
    performance of the pff algorithm. may, 1976 chu, w. w.

    budget to research into aspects of public librarianship. since
    1978 the british library has sponsored a number of projects
    concerned with on-line information services in public
    libraries, including the biros and 'guidelines' projects. the
    biros (bibliographic information retrieval online service)
    project involved the development by staff of manchester
    polytechnic of an on-line information retrieval system for use
    in lancashire county library, whilst the 'guidelines' project
    studied the use of on-line systems in public libraries. the

    were used largely by businessmen and college and university
    teachers. the project was unable to provid e a solution to the

    <text>shifting garbage collection overhead to compile time this
    paper discusses techniques which enable automatic storage
    reclamation overhead to be partially shifted to compile time.
    the paper assumes a transaction oriented collection scheme, as
    proposed by deutsch and bobrow, the necessary features of which
    are summarized. implementing the described optimizations
    requires global flow analysis to be performed on the source
    program. it is shown that at compile time certain program
    actions that affect the reference counts of cells can be
    deduced. this information is used to find actions that cancel
    when the code is executed and those that can be grouped to
    achieve improved efficiency. july, 1977 barth, j. m. garbage

    <text>why produce current bibliographies in the netherlands?.
    more than 100 current bibliographies are being published at the
    present time in the netherlands. in the past many attempts to
    produce current bibliographies have failed from lack of
    financial support. in the field of bibliographical control the
    most important development has been the introduction of the
    computer enabling complex searches to be made rapidly on very
    large data bases. major reasons for producing a current
    bibliography include the wish to keep abreast of material
    published in or about an individual country or region and the
    desire to make scattered references on a particular subject
    more readily available. in future the emphasis in
    bibliographical control will be on more comprehensive
    coverage.</text>

    <text>analysis of decay-type data* a comparative study has been
    made of a variety of numerical techniques for fitting
    experimental data of the decay type by forms involving the sums
    of exponentials. statistical errors of the fitted parameters
    are also calculated. these methods have been applied to
    artificially-generated sets of data as well as to the results
    of experiments with radioactive tracers on both human and
    animal subjects. results show that the values of the fitted
    parameters are very sensitive to variations in the fitting
    procedure. therefore great care very sensitive to variations in
    the fitting procedure. therefore great care must be exercised
    in identifying such values with physical constants. although
    the values of functions derived from these fitted parameters
    which can definitely be associated with physical entities are
    generally more stable under variations in the fitting
    techniques, error bounds can be so large that no great
    confidence can be placed even in them. it would therefore
    appear best to select a uniform technique both for running the
    experiments and for analyzing the data, and then to consider as
    significant only relative results between one subject and the

    1973-74 and 74 of 1979-80. these emphasise that there must be
    equality for all to practise religious, cultural, and social
    activities. libraries must make literature and other media
    available so that immigrants can maintain their cultural links
    with the mother country. but they must also make material
    available which can facilitate that immigrants' adaptation to
    the new country and its language and give the majority
    population information on the immigrants' background. the
    deichman library in oslo began in 1975 to act as a central
    library to public libraries as regards immigrant literature.
    the library also issues deposits to libraries. stresses the

    translated into logical representations which are integrated
    into the knowledge base as an organised knowledge structure.
    queries are also in natural language, from which retrieval
    commands are automatically generated. answers are synthesised
    from the results of retrieval. a working system called lgs

    as: (1) the elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for
    linking elementary statements together, (3) the means by which
    a program can obtain data inputs. several alternative forms of
    each of these components are also described, compared and
    evaluated. many examples, frequently from list processing
    languages, illustrate the forms described. the advantages,
    disadvantages and factors influencing the choice of a form of
    component for a language are discussed, and the paper concludes
    with the suggestion that programming languages evolve toward
    one which will permit all the most convenient ways of

    <text>secure communications over insecure channels according to

    necessary to transmit a key, by secret means, before encrypted
    messages can be sent securely. this paper shows that it is
    possible to select a key over open communications channels in
    such a fashion that communications security can be maintained.
    a method is described which forces any enemy to expend an
    amount of work which increases as the square of the work
    required of the two communicants to select the key. the method
    provides a logically new kind of protection against the passive
    eaves dropper. it suggests that further research on this topic
    will be highly rewarding, both in a theoretical and a practical

    every point of an edge are found. the computing time increases
    roughly as the square of the number of edges. the algorithm
    takes advantage of a reduced number of concave points and
    automatically recognizes if only one object with no concave
    points is considered. in this last case, the result is obtained

    <text>stoic influences in librarianship: a critique. paper
    presented at library history seminar vi 'libraries &amp;
    culture', austin, texas, 19-22 mar 80. expresses a deep
    indebtedness by librarians and information scientists to the
    thought and culture of ancient greece, but sounds a warning to
    information scientists that some of the lessons learned from
    the greeks are being blindly and unthinkingly misapplied today,
    to the detriment of clear thinking about library problems.
    describes the ancient greek theory of the sign expressing the
    relation between words, thoughts, and things which is still
    influential in philosophy, linguistics, and psychology, but is
    often inappropriately invoked in these disciplines and in
    library and information science and the study of communication.
    the model is ambiguous, and so an alternative, based on human
    linguistics, is proposed.</text>

    based on a linear analysis of the definition points of the

    program. the objectives of the processing are (1) to eliminate
    redundant calculations when references are made to common
    subexpression values, (2) to remove invariant calculations from
    do loops, (3) to efficiently compute subscripts containing do
    iteration variables, and (4) to provide efficient index
    register usage. the method presented requires at least a
    three-pass compiler, the second of which is scanned backward.
    it has been used in the development of several fortran

    <text>experiences in the introduction of on-line services in
    industry. on-line services have been offered on a commercial
    basis in west germany since 1975, but are still not widely
    used. an example of an on-line service used in industry is
    dokumentation maschinenbau (doma). this service has 17 users in
    industry, mainly in mechanical engineering branches but also in
    electrical engineering, chemical and consumer goods concerns.
    the users are generally confined to large scale businesses
    employing between 1,000-25,000 people. to make efficient use of
    the doma service it is necessary to have been running a
    successful documentation department for several years, to use
    the on-line service to implement the existing information
    activity and to have staff who are kept up to date with
    research and development of on-line services. doma provides
    personnel training and helps with installation of hardware
    besides providing advice during the trial period. this aspect
    of on-line services is vital and to underest imate leads to

    <text>abstract data types and the development of data
    structures abstract data types can play a significant role in
    the development of software that is reliable, efficient, and
    flexible. this paper presents and discusses the application of
    an algebraic technique for the specification of abstract data
    types. among the examples presented is a top-down development
    of a symbol table for a block structured language; a discussion
    of the proof of its correctness is given. the paper also
    contains a brief discussion of the problems involved in
    constructing algebraic specifications that are both consistent
    and complete. june, 1977 guttag, j. abstract data type,

    <text>the complete specification of a network by a single
    parameter if the transfer function of a linear passive network
    is defined as the output response divided by the input driving
    force it can be written in iether polar of cartesian form where
    is the amplitude response is the phase characteristic is the in
    phase component and is the quadrature component the transient
    response to a unit step function can be determined within a
    constant from either alone and are all related and any one can
    be used to compute the other two the derivation of these
    relations is valid for networks with either distributed or
    lumped constants including transducers and the question of
    minimum phase does not arise a graphic method is described for
    computing from either and universal curves are included
    equipment is described which sweeps or a polar plot of and
    directly an intensity frequency marker circuit is included
    which produces multiple harmonically related dots on the sweep
    response it is also possible to sweep the departure from phase
    linearity by a heterodyne process the sweep can be used on low

    <text>the case of the missing subtitle. with reference to the
    relevant passages in aacr2 and isbd(g), notes the elimination
    of the term 'subtitle' and the resultant difficulties.
    subtitles will not disappear just because they are no longer
    called by that name. the term must be reinstated in the
    official vocabulary of cataloguing and operational definitions
    of 'title proper' and 'subtitle' formulated. such action would
    go a long way towards uniform implementation of the rules,
    leaving much less to the individual interpretation of the
    catalogues and resulting in greater entry

    <text>automated acquisitions systems' keynote address.
    contribution to the lita (american library association. library
    and information technology association) institute. librarians
    should be aware of the rapid progress being made toward
    integrated systems and make the acquisitions automation
    decision in that light. contrasts the mid-60s and early 80s in
    terms of technology and library needs. in the mid-60s, emphasis
    was on ordering, and technology was limiting both in terms of
    costs and capabilities. at the beginning of the 80s libraries
    have numerous acquisitions available, including turnkey systems
    from some circulation system vendors and the acquisitions
    subsystems of the bibliographic utilities. it is unlikely that
    a single source will offer a library the most suitable features
    for each function, and the problem becomes one of integrating
    systems from several sources.</text>

    <text>the purchasing key' a method for programming and
    controlling collective purchasing. since the 1960s the
    centralisation of stock processing and advisory work on book
    selection has demanded rationalisation methods in library
    organisation. the use of purchasing key codes in dresden's
    large municipal library system is described. in a collective
    purchasing decision each participant can use the key to make
    decisions for the whole network; thus individual responsibility
    for literature provision becomes greater. using a key also
    ensures balanced stock proportions throughout the whole network
    and takes into account demands for time saving and for improved
    stock quality, thus offering an optimal solution for unifying
    stocks in a territorial network.</text>

    services have been initiated, such as mobile library services,
    record libraries and services to foreign workers and open
    school students. in addition, the dutch government plans to
    increase the number of regional support libraries from 13 to
    19. however, enschede public library, which has been designated
    a regional support library, is compelled by financial cutbacks
    to reduce its present staffing levels by 25%. as a result the
    library will be unable to maintain the current volume of loans
    and consideration has been given to limiting the number of
    books which a borrower may take throughout the year and to
    refusing to enrol new members.</text>

    <text>a strategy for archiving government data to meet the

    identified 2,352 major government data banks in canada. in
    response to a growing recognition that government has gone too
    far in its data collection activities, it is trying to reduce
    its 'paperburden'. perhaps one solution is to institute a
    rational and consistent strategy for archiving these government
    data, but still meet the needs of the research community.
    suggests that the canadian government must establish the
    information over which it has ownership and the condition of
    such ownership; no government record may be destroyed or
    altered without consent from the dominion archivist or his
    designate; and the dominion archivist must have the right to

    <text>shoddy and pernicious books and youthful purity' literary
    and moral censorship, then and now. paper presented at the 41st
    conference of the graduate library school, university of
    chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
    materials in school and public libraries. though some
    librarians and teachers believe censorship is a recent
    phenomenon, it has been a part of librarians' lives for more
    than a century. indeed, many late-19th century librarians
    regarded themselves primarily as censors, duty-bound to protect
    the young from shoddy and pernicious books, especially fiction.
    some librarians and teachers today carry on this censorial
    tradition by circulating or teaching only works of high
    literary merit or the proper moral content. those censoring on
    literary grounds often provide only subjective criteria,
    justifying censorship by their own personal tastes. those
    censoring on moral grounds often provide no better criteria,
    justifying censorship by their own personal morality. libr
    arians and teachers have no right to impose personal literary
    or moral standards on the public, young or old. they have a
    duty to provide materials of all sorts to allow clients and
    students to search through and seek out ideas.</text>

    <text>effective information retrieval using term accuracy the
    performance of information retrieval systems can be evaluated
    in a number of different ways. much of the published evaluation
    work is based on measuring the retrieval performance of an
    average user query. unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
    to construct for the average case. in the present study,
    retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the performance of
    a specific user query. the concept of query term accuracy is in
    troduced as the probability of occurrence of a query term in
    the documents relevant to that query. by relating term accuracy
    to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the documents of
    a collection it is possible to give formal proofs of the
    effectiveness with respect to a given user query of a number of
    automatic indexing systems that have been used successfully in
    experimental situations. among these are inverse document
    frequency weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase

    <text>subgoal induction a proof method, subgoal induction, is
    presented as an alternative or supplement to the commonly used
    inductive assertion method. its major virtue is that it can
    often be used to prove a loop's correctness directly from its
    input-output specification without the use of an invariant. the
    relation between subgoal induction and other commonly used
    induction rules is explored and, in particular, it is shown
    that subgoal induction can be viewed as a specialized form of
    computation induction. a set of sufficient conditions are
    presented which guarantee that an input-output specification is
    strong enough for the induction steps of a proof by subgoal
    induction to be valid. april, 1977 morris, j. h. jr. wegbreit,

    self-teaching programmes are very important; audio-visual media
    are particularly helpful in demonstrating the operation of
    machinery. some students will have learning difficulties and a
    lack of motivation; provision of material for leisure as well
    as academic activities should encourage them to use the

    government and private enterprise, its importance as a
    resource, and what information management involves. the
    librarian accordingly must adapt his skills to the demands of
    the particular environment, where involvement in information
    management and the organisation's operations requires active
    participation in planning activities and operations support.
    suggests how similar organisations could share information
    resources through network cooperation, and illustrates the
    librarian's role in supporting organisation operations. finally
    emphasises the importance of adapting training programmes to
    recognise the kind of demands the librarian will meet in this
    context.</text>

    <text>an improved program-synthesizing algorithm and its
    correctness an improved program-synthesizing algorithm based on
    the algorithm proposed by waldinger and lee in 1969 is given.
    in the old algorithm, the program-synthesizing problem is
    translated into a theorem-proving problem, and a program is
    obtained by analyzing a proof. for the improved algorithm, the
    analysis is not necessary, and a program is obtained as soon as
    the proof is completed. this is achieved by using a modified
    variable tracing mechanism invented by green in 1969. the
    correctness of the improved algorithm is also proved; i.e. the
    program thus obtained always satisfies the specification.

    <text>two-level control structure for nondeterministic
    programming the basic ideas of nondeterministic programming are
    critically reconsidered to single out a proper attitude and
    programming style for language allowing direct control of
    nondeterministic features. the proposed attitude aims at
    retaining the purity of the nondeterministic formulation of
    search processes on one level (the attempt level), deferring
    the coordination of problem solving efforts to another (the
    choice level). the feasibility of recognizing these two levels
    is discussed, stressing that the structure to be managed at the
    choice level is a free of contexts. the leaves are
    computational environments, each holding an alternative under
    inspection, while the other nodes are associated with choice
    poin ts. according to the proposed programming style, a
    generative function is associated with each choice poin t,
    which expresses the desired choice strategy. the main advantage
    on this approach is the localization of the search strategies:
    each nonterminal node of the tree keeps track of the state of
    the computation as it was when the choice poin t was last
    interrogated, holding at the same time the strategy to
    coordinate the available alternatives. examples are given in
    term of nd-lisp, an extension of lisp designed and implemented
    according to these guidelines. october, 1977 montangero, c.

    particular procedure that is appropriate depends upon whether

    can be recognized as such prior to its rounding. november, 1964

    <text>texture and reflection in computer generated images in
    1974 catmull developed a new algorithm for rendering images of
    bivariate surface patches. this paper describes extensions of
    this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting
    models. the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
    system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the
    surface. the intensity of the pattern at each picture element
    is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern
    definition function. the shape and size of this weighting
    function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. the
    patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the
    surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting
    the simulation of the mirror reflections. the amount of light
    coming from a given direction is modeled in a similar manner to
    the texture mapping and then added to the intensity obtained
    from the texture mapping. several examples of images
    synthesized using these new techniques are included. october,

    possible parallelism of operation. most of the presently known
    compilation techniques are inadequate for such a processor
    because they produce expression structures that must be
    evaluated serially. a technique is presented here for compiling
    arithmetic expressions into structures that can be evaluated
    with a high degree of parallelism. the algorithm is a variant
    of the so-called "top-down" analysis technique, and requires
    only one pass of the input text. april, 1967 stone, h. s.

    <text>a view from brazil. contribution to a section devoted to
    planning interlending systems for developing countries. factors
    that influence library planning in brazil include its large
    size, its very young population, its struggling
    semi-industrialised economy, the uneven level of education, and
    low levels of research activity and publishing output.
    modernisation means that the demand for documents is
    potentially very large. document supply will be organised
    through different economic or administrative sectors, such as
    agriculture, energy, or education. however, these will need to
    be coordinated to avoid gaps or unnecessary duplication in
    subject coverage, and some degree of centralisation is
    desirable.</text>

    <text>an experimental comparison of time sharing and batch

    the ibm ibsys batch-processing system by means of a
    statistically designed experiment. an identical set of four
    programming problems was assigned to each of a group of four
    programming subjects. influences external to the systems, such
    as the sequence of problem solution, and programmer and problem
    characteristics, were specified as design factors in the
    experiment. data was obtained for six variables (e.g.,
    programmer time, computer time, elapsed time, etc.) which were
    considered to be definitive of "system effectiveness," and
    analysis of variance techniques were employed to estimate
    system differences in these variables after differences due to
    the design factors had been eliminated. statistical analysis of
    the experimental results provided strong evidence of important
    system differences, as well as a critique of the experimental
    design itself with implications for further experimentation.

    <text>programming decision tables in fortran, cobol or algol a
    simple broad-based approach for programming decision tables in
    fortran or cobol is developed and presented. with inputs in
    standard form, as defined in the paper, the programming of any
    decision table can be done with one or two fortran statements,
    or with two cobol statements, if the compute verb is available
    in the cobol processor. it is shown that the method is
    applicable even when there are more than two mutually exclusive
    states of one, two or more table conditions. it is further
    shown that multi-state conditions in decision tables can often
    simplify the programming. the method outlined has the further
    advantage that all possible combinations of conditions are
    considered. it is shown that the suggested procedure is easily
    implemented in algol. january, 1966 veinott, c. g. ca660107 jb

    <text>a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval theorem for
    associative memories an efficient method of ordered retrieval
    of binary words from an associative memory, as described by
    lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits which
    indicate the digit values present in the individual digit
    columns of the memory. thus the circuits indicate whether the
    individual digit columns contain digits of both values, or of
    only one value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the
    memory is empty). the use of these circuits, which in this
    paper are termed column value indicators, reduces considerably
    the number of memory accesses necessary to retrieve in order a
    number of distinct words from the memory. lewin proves that,
    for the readout by the described method of m distinct binary
    words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary. (thus he proves
    that the number of necessary memory accesses of his method,
    unlike those of other methods, is independent of the word
    length.) in this paper a very simple proof of this theorem
    derived from some elementary aspects of the structure of sets
    of binary numbers is presented. july, 1968 wolinsky, a.

    <text>a translating computer interface for end-user operation
    of heterogeneous retrieval systems. 2. evaluations. the
    evaluation of the concept of a translating computer interface
    for simplifying operation of multiple, heterogeneous on-line
    bibliographic retrieval systems has been undertaken. an
    experimental retrieval system, named conit, was built and
    tested under controlled conditions with inexperienced end
    users. a detailed analysis of the experimental usages showed
    that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently
    well to find relevant document references. success was
    attributed, in part, to a simple command language, adequate
    on-line instruction, and a simplified natural language,
    keyword/stem approach to searching. it is concluded that
    operational interfaces of the type studied can provide for
    increased usability of existing systems in a cost effective
    manner, especially for inexperienced end users who cannot
    easily avail themselves of expert intermediary searchers.
    furthermo re, more advanced interfaces based on improved
    instruction and automated search strategy techniques could
    further enhance retrieval effectiveness for a wide class of
    users. for part 1, 2see1 preceding abstract.</text>

    <text>application of sociology, psychology and pedagogy to
    librarianship. the 1st and foremost task of librarians in
    bulgaria is to educate their readers and to exercise influence
    on their reading habits. to be capable of performing the job
    successfully, librarians must acquire a working knowledge of
    sociology, psychology and pedagogy. thus, they will not only
    see each reader as an individual with his/her own family and
    educational background, personal qualities, and professional
    requirements, but they will also be able to make the best of a
    leader's authority in a group. education of children and
    adolescents has benefitted from collaboration between teachers
    and librarians and the experience gained must now be used more
    fully in adult education. on the other hand, sociology,
    psychology and pedagogy must be applied to set criteria for the
    personality of a good librarian, library management and the
    methodological guidance of the rank and file library

    periodicals and controlling the roman catholic public libraries
    in bavaria. each parish library is subordinate to its diocesan
    centre and the state library centre provides a number of
    centralised services and overall administration. the league
    publishes a reviewing journal jointly with the borromeus
    association, a quarterly information sheet on library
    activities in bavaria, book lists and a handbook for the use of
    the staff, mainly volunteers, for whom short training courses
    are provided. close cooperation is maintained with local
    government. since 1968 the league has compiled annual
    statistics by electronic data processing; the programme is also
    used every 3 years for the compilation of statistics on all
    church libraries in west germany.</text>

    effect on the reliability of the resulting programs. this paper
    discusses an experiment that compares the programming
    reliability of subjects using a statically typed language and a
    "typeless" language. analysis of the number of errors and the
    number of runs containing errors shows that, at least in one
    environment, the use of a statically typed language can
    increase programming reliability. detailed analysis of the
    errors made by the subjects in programming solutions to
    reasonably small problems shows that the subjects had

    (x*,y*), we discuss a method for computing gauss harmonic
    interpolation formulas for r and the point (x*,y*). such
    formulas approximate a harmonic function at (x*,y*) in terms of
    a linear combination of its values at certain selected points
    on the boundary of r. such formulas are useful for
    approximating the solution of the dirichlet problem for r.

    <text>a model for a multifunctional teaching system a teaching
    system model that was incorporated into an operating system of
    a large computer is described. the model transferred control to
    the operating system to execute functions other than teaching,
    and then recovered control in order to resume teaching. the
    teaching system (abac-ii) was written to run under the
    operating system (ibsys) for the ibm 7044 graphic system.
    because the teaching system automatically terminated and
    rescheduled itself, a student studying a course presented at a
    cathode-ray display terminal could switch readily between
    student mode and programmer mode. during the latter, the full
    resources of the operating system (language processors,
    compilers, library and user's programs) were at his disposal.
    he could for example, write, assemble, debug, and execute at
    the terminal a program written in any language processed by the
    operating system. a course could therefore include text
    material interleaved with programming problems which the
    student could solve without leaving the terminal. exercises in
    simulation and gaming could also be provided. the implications
    of a teaching system with this degree of flexibility for
    industrial and executive training as well as academic education
    are discussed. in addition, the advantages of this type of
    system for computer programming and operation are also
    considered. june, 1967 engvold, k. j. hughes, j. l. ca670601 jb

    that, in order to maintain a good standard of public library

    into how much of the greatly increased output of british
    publishing should be purchased today. points out that what

    not matching those withdrawn through wear and tear, and that

    <text>a simple algorithm for computing the generalized inverse
    of a matrix the generalized inverse of a matrix is important in
    analysis because it provides an extension of the concept of an
    inverse which applies to all matrices. it also has many
    applications in numerical analysis, but it is not widely used
    because the existing algorithms are fairly complicated and
    require considerable storage space. a simple extension has been
    found to the conventional orthogonalization method for
    inverting non-singular matrices, which gives the generalized
    inverse with little extra effort and with no additional storage
    requirements. the algorithm gives the generalized inverse for
    any m by n matrix a, including the special case when m+n and a
    is non-singular and the case when m&gt;n and rank(a) = n. in
    the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary inverse of a.
    in the second case the algorithm yields the ordinary least
    squares transformation matrix inv(a'a)a' and has the advantage
    of avoiding the loss of significance which results in forming

    <text>file as a dependable archivist. the current state of the
    art of information processing tends to link certain
    capabilities (such as protection of data integrity and
    confidentiality and monitoring user/data interactions) with
    large data base systems. this is most unfortunate, since such
    capabilities are frequently vital for modest applications which
    do not have the degree of data complexity to justify the use of
    large data base systems and which may not be able to afford
    them. describes an effort to bridge this gap in current
    electronic data processing technology by means of a new
    linguistic concept of files which is designed to simulate a

    <text>this one-sided praxis-worship. a norwegian state library
    school student rebuts 3 claims made by previous writers
    (special section on library education in norway, 2ibid1 46 (8)
    1979; 2see1 81/60)' (1) that lecturers have too little
    practical library experience (&amp;h have extensive library
    experience, while the others maintain contact with current
    library practice); (2) that the course contains too little
    practical training (the new 3-year theoretical curriculum is a
    step forward. internal and external practical work, though
    still necessary, are of limited value in a constantly
    developing national library system. the school's primary task
    is to educate independent, critical librarians who can evaluate
    their role in a sociological perspective and be open to
    development and change); and (3) that instruction is too
    theoretical (on the contrary, there is a tendency to over-value
    diligence and hard work, viewing librarianship as a service
    industry rather than a scholarly discipline). a more library
    /sociological- and project-oriented curriculum is needed,
    calling for a different type of commitment from both students
    and lecturers.</text>

    <text>public relations work-tendencies and expectations. the
    standard of library public relations work in west germany is
    often considered to be lower than that in other countries.
    increasing financial problems in local government will soon
    make the libraries' task of keeping up with media industry
    trends more difficult. if public libraries still wish to be
    regarded as the institutions responsible for contemporary work
    with cultural media, they must provide better publicity. each
    library has individual features which can provide a focal point
    in public relations. librarians must establish good
    relationships with other local cultural organisations, who will
    then support cultural activities in the library, resulting in
    less expenditure for the librarian. the librarian should be a
    'cultural agent provocateur', organising cultural activities
    not only to increase loans but also to improve library service
    quality.</text>

    and (2) there is a significant saving in the number of calls to

    chop and round modes of arithmetic with various numbers of
    guard digits, and with a modified round mode with guard digits.
    in a certain sense, arithmetic systems differing only in their
    use of binary or hexadecimal number representations are shown
    to be approximately statistically equivalent inaccuracy.
    further, the usual round mode with guard digits is shown to be
    statistically superior in accuracy to the usual chop mode in
    all cases save one. the modified round mode is found to be
    superior to the chop mode in all cases. april, 1973 kuki, h.

    econometric models of the u.s. computer market have been
    developed to study the relationships between system price and
    hardware performance. single measures of price/performance such
    as "grosch's law" are shown to be so over simplified as to be
    meaningless. multiple-regression models predicting system cost
    as a function of several hardware characteristics do, however,
    reveal a market dichotomy. on one hand there exists a stable,
    price predictable market for larger, general purpose computer
    systems. the other market is the developing one for small
    business computer systems, a market which is relatively
    unstable with low price predictability. april, 1979 cale, e.g.

    <text>a code for non-numeric information processing
    applications in online systems a code has been specifically
    designed to simplify the internal information processing
    operations within an online computer system with respect to
    non-numeric applications, and to maximize the transfer rate of
    the information channel linking the system and the system user.
    the code has direct application to problems in area such as
    information retrieval, document classification, computer-aided
    teaching and text editing. this code, called ipc (information
    processing code), is an 8-bit code set constructed so that 7,
    6, 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derived from the basic
    set. the code set is organized so that simple binary operations
    can distinguish between the numeric alphabetic, special symbol
    and control character codes. the number of usable characters
    within the basic set size may be expanded either by use of
    escape codes included in the set, or by suitable interpretation
    of otherwise unassigned codes on the basis of the requirements
    of local environments. january, 1967 morenoff, e. mclean, j. b.

    <text>parallel numerical methods for the solution of equations
    classical iterative procedures for the numerical solution of
    equations provide at each stage a single new approximation to
    the root in question. a technique is given for the development
    of numerical procedures which provide, at each stage, several
    approximations to a solution of an equation. the s8everal
    approximations obtained in any iteration are computationally
    independent, making the methods of interest in a parallel
    processing environment. convergence is insured by extracting
    the "best information" at each iteration. several families of
    numerical procedures which use the technique of the procedures
    in a parallel processing environment are developed and
    measurements of these statistics are reported. these
    measurements are interpreted in a parallel processing
    environment. in such an environment the procedures obtained are
    superior to standard algorithms. may, 1967 shedler, g. s.

    national council for librarianship and documentation formerly
    elaborated a middle-range research programme for hungarian
    libraries during 1976-80. this study assesses to what extent
    the programme has been carried out. the most active areas of
    development have been in the field of reading research and
    investigations preceding the introduction of mechanised
    information storage and retrieval systems. other areas of
    research have been in the collection development field and
    exploration of written documents of the hungarian culture.
    finally, the study makes proposals for translation or
    adaptation to hungarian circumstances of some fundamental
    reference books published abroad on librarianship and
    information science in order to synthesise current knowledge

    <text>a genealogy of control structures the issue of program
    control structures has had a history of heated controversy. to
    put this issue on a solid footing, this paper reviews numerous
    theoretical results on control structures and explores their
    practical implications. the classic result of bohm and jacopini
    on the theoretical completeness of if-then-else and while-do is
    discussed. several recent ideas on control structures are then
    explored. these include a review of various other control
    structures, results on time/space limitations, and theorems
    relating the relative power of control structures under notions
    of equivalence. in conclusion, the impact of theoretical
    results on the practicing programmer and the importance of
    one-in, one-out control structures as operational abstractions
    are discussed. it is argued further that there is insufficient
    evidence to warrant more than if-then-else, while-do, and their
    variants. november, 1975 ledgard, h. f. marcotty, m. structured

    <text>turkish library developments. the important role of
    library science came to be gradually appreciated in turkey only
    in the 1940s when adnan otuken returned from library science
    studies in germany. determined to make librarianship a
    recognised profession, he campaigned for a national library
    (established in 1946), taught library science (basis of
    department of library science at ankara university), and helped
    found the turkish library association in 1949. public and
    children's libraries have increased in numbers in the last
    decade (244 to 700 and 174 to 400). their problems include lack
    of trained staff and the 180,000 manuscripts and rare books in
    their care. university library development has been uneven and
    school libraries are most neglected. turdok (national
    documentation centre for science and technology) was
    established in 1966. library education programmes have been

    <text>either we move or else we stop accepting more books.
    describes the deposit library and its space problems. unless
    the library moves from its present accommodation in the
    basement of the library school within half a year, it will have
    to start refusing books from public libraries. the library's
    purpose is to store books which have been culled from public
    libraries and to lend or give them to other libraries, and
    therefore it must necessarily grow at a time when other
    libraries contract. the library began in 1968 with 1400 sq.m.;
    later a further 175 sq.m. were added for shelving and 1000
    sq.m. in a warehouse elsewhere. a suitable building of 7700
    sq.m. is now available cheaply. with an increase of 25,000
    volumes a year, this would secure enough space until the 90s.
    running costs will be 5.1 million kr. in 82 as compared to the
    present 3.6 million kr., and cost of establishment will be 2.7
    million kr. the danish library association, the national
    association of local authorities and the librar y council have
    now recommended that the money should come from the public
    libraries' disposition fund, not otherwise used for such
    purposes, as the source of the library's finance, the public
    libraries' joint appropriation, would be unable to cope. the
    library is a last resort, after the central libraries, for
    ordinary people for the lending of older books and meets 55% of
    enquiries, a figure which would be higher if a catalogue of
    holdings existed.</text>

    <text>an interactive computer graphics approach to surface
    representation an in teractive computer graphics method has
    been developed for the rapid generation of arbitrary shaped
    three-dimensional surfaces. the method is a synthesis of spline
    theory and algorithms, an in teractive means for man-machine
    communication, and software for static or dynamic graphics
    display. the basic technique employed is a modified lofting
    method on which sectional curves are represented by uniform
    b-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sections by
    cardinal splines. among the features of this method are
    algorithms which enable in teractive modification of the
    b-spline representation of the sectional curves. at all stages
    of the process, the spatial information is graphically
    displayed to the user. complex surfaces can be created by the
    combination of a number of shapes that have been separately
    generated and automatically joined. the system has been
    successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical routines
    for structural, medical and graphical applications. october,

    <text>machine-readable output from online searches.
    machine-readable output (mro) from on-line searches is useful
    in the compilation of large bibliographies. arrangements were
    made with a major on-line retrieval vendor to obtain (for a
    fee) output in the form of magnetic tape, rather than
    conventional off-line prints on paper. a programme was written
    to transform and process the data; part of this programme is
    similar to a computer compiler. a method of checking for
    duplicate items was developed. mro is cost-effective and
    eliminates the time-consuming and labour-intensive data entry
    process. it is a natural extension of the powers of on-line
    retrieval systems.</text>

    <text>an efficient data structure for the simulation event set
    recently algorithms have been presented for the realization of
    event scheduling routines suitable for general purpose discrete
    event simulation systems. several exhibited a performance
    superior to that of commonly used simple linked list
    algorithms. in this paper a new event scheduling algorithm is
    presented which improves on two aspects of the best of the
    previously published algorithms. first, the new algorithm's
    performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions, and
    second, its worst-case complexity is o( n), where n is the
    number of events in the set. furthermore, tests conducted to
    estimate the average complexity showed it to be nearly
    independent of n. august, 1977 franta, w. r. maly, k.

    <text>the multics virtual memory: concepts and design as
    experience with use of on-line operating systems has grown, the
    need to share information among system users has become
    increasingly apparent. many contemporary systems permit some
    degree of sharing. usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing
    several users to share data via input and output of information
    stored in files kept in secondary storage. through the use of
    segmentation, however, multics provides direct hardware
    addressing by user and system programs of all information,
    independent of its physical storage location. information is
    stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and
    carries its own independent attributes of size and access
    privilege. here, the design and implementation considerations
    of segmentation and sharing in multics are first discussed
    under the assumption that all information resides in large,
    segmented main memory. since the size of main memory on

    <text>recovery of reentrant list structures in slip one
    consequence of the reference-count-based space-recovery system
    employed by slip is that reentrant list structures are not
    recovered even when explicitly erased. lisp-like
    garbage-collection schemes are free of this impediment. they
    however, depend on being able to find and mark nodes that are
    reachable from program variables. by tracing all descendants
    from program variables may then be identified and collected.
    the list-creating function list of slip may be amended to mark
    those lists for which the programmer wishes to assume
    responsibility. given this modification, a lisp-like garbage
    collector that recovers abandoned reentrant list structures may
    then be appended to the slip system. july, 1969 weizenbaum, j.

    <text>the academic librarian. the career of a librarian should
    combine the practical side of librarianship with academic
    knowledge and research. nowadays new research in library
    science is usually carried out in teams rather than by
    individuals. modern librarians have to possess a wide range of
    knowledge covering many fields and it is no longer usual for a
    librarian to be an expert in only 1 subject. teachers at
    library schools are often part-time librarians and provide
    students with an understanding of daily library activity, which
    prevents courses from becoming merely theoretical. the changing
    structure of academic libraries is reflected in the syllabuses
    of library schools which devote more time to current library

    <text>brad: the brookhaven raster display a multiconsole
    computer display system has been designed that provides very
    rich displays at low unit cost. each brad (brookhaven raster
    display) console can plot tens of thousands of points, or up to
    4000 characters at 30 frames per second. after an initial
    display system investment of $50,000 each display, with
    teletype, costs less than $3,000. the technique employed is
    that of programmatically generating a binary image of the
    desired display in a computer. the image is written on a
    rotating drum memory. independent read heads continuously
    display the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal
    lines. a standard tv monitor serves as the display device. the
    technique has two drawbacks. a computer must compute any image
    to be displayed. also, the "pointing" interaction is more
    difficult. this is because the pointing function gives only the
    coordinates of the point on the screen. the inverse of the map
    generation process is required to calculate the coordinates of
    the point on the screen. the inverse of the map generation
    process is required to calculate the coordinates at the
    selected point in the input space. june, 1968 ophir, d.

    <text>implementing clenshaw-curtis quadrature, i methodology
    and experience clenshaw-curtis quadrature is a particularly
    important automatic quadrature scheme for a variety of reasons,
    especially the high accuracy obtained from relatively few
    integrand values. however, it has received little use because
    it requires the computation of a cosine transformation and the
    arithmetic cost of this has been prohibitive. this paper is in
    two parts; a companion paper, "ii computing the cosine
    transformation," shows that this objection can be overcome by
    computing the cosine transformation by a modification of the
    fast fourier transform algorithm. this first part discusses the
    strategy and various error estimates, and summarizes experience
    with a particular implementation of the scheme. may, 1972

    <text>books and people: the desirability of coordinated

    increasingly important in the planning of library policy. in
    the past too much research into library use has served only to
    confirm what was already suspected, that public library users
    belong mainly to the higher income and better educated sections
    of society. in the netherlands the bureau voor de collectieve
    propaganda van het nederlandse boek (office for the joint
    promotion of dutch books) has designated a 'book of the month'
    as a special offer each month since 1970. a new organisation
    should be created in the netherlands with representatives from
    the publishing houses, all sections of the library world and
    from government departments to investigate ways of stimulating,
    coordinating and subsidising the nation's reading

    <text>on the inclusiveness of systems for retrieval documents
    indexed by unweighted descriptors. one means of reducing
    information retrieval time is by taking advantage of the
    property of inclusiveness of information retrieval systems.
    when one knows the system response to a query which is more
    general in relation to another query, then in an inclusive
    retrieval system in order to retrieve the response to the more
    specific query it suffices to limit the information retrieval
    process to the search of the system response to the more
    general query. demonstrates the property of inclusiveness of
    document retrieval systems where documents are indexed by
    unweighted descriptors, and in which query search patterns are
    boolean functions of descriptors (systems using the inverted
    file method, the canonical structure file-method, or the
    sequential file method). the paper presents 3 methods for a
    determining a partial ordering relation on a set of boolean
    search patterns of queries, implying a partial orderi ng on the
    set of the system responses to these queries and discusses the
    adequacy of each method depending on the information retrieval
    method used.</text>

    association of parish librarians, the position as part-time
    librarian was usually honorary and unpaid, a fact which caused
    lack of esteem for the job. there was little interest in
    membership and the association had to be financially supported
    by the group of parish library committees, the members'
    employers. hostility has been met from the librarians'
    association and later the librarians' union, unnecessarily, as
    the part-time librarians on the whole recognise the ultimate
    goal of full-time libraries staffed by professional librarians,
    but insist on satisfactory transitional arrangements. there
    should be a chance for part-time librarians through
    supplementary courses to qualify as librarians, and it is

    <text>covering edges by cliques with regard to keyword
    conflicts and intersection graphs kellerman has presented a
    method for determining keyword conflicts and described a
    heuristic algorithm which solves a certain combinatorial
    optimization problem in connection with this method. this
    optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent to the
    problem of covering the edges of a graph by complete subgraphs
    with the objective of minimizing the number of complete
    subgraphs. a relationship between this edge-clique-cover
    problem and the graph coloring problem is established which
    allows algorithms for either one of these problems to be
    constructed from algorithm for the other. as consequences of
    this relationship, the keyword conflict problem and the
    edge-clique-cover problem are shown to be np-complete, and if
    p=/np then they do not admit polynomial-time approximation
    algorithms which always produce solutions within a factor less

    <text>a system for typesetting mathematics this paper describes
    the design and implementation of a system for typesetting
    mathematics. the language has been designed to be easy to learn
    and to use by people (for example, secretaries and mathematical
    typists) who know neither mathematics nor typesetting.
    experience indicates that the language can be learned in an
    hour or so, for it has few rules and fewer exceptions. for
    typical expressions, the size and font changes, positioning,
    line drawing, and the like necessary to print according to
    mathematical conventions are all done automatically. for
    example, the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 2
    produces (formula). the syntax of the language is specified by
    a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler is used to
    make a compiler that translates this language into typesetting
    commands. output maybe produced on either a phototypesetter or
    on a terminal with forward and reverse half-line motions. the
    system interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so
    mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled simply. this
    paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

    this pilot study enabled the librarian to alter the research
    design, notably by prompting increased pupil participation and
    an improved questionnaire. 258 children in the author's own
    school took a standardised comprehension test and completed the
    new questionnaire. a panel of children catalogued the school's
    4,793 books under 2 main classifications-fiction and
    information, and sorted them into 50 categories. discussions
    and decisions were taped. 1 in 20 books were assessed for their

    <text>database abstractions: aggregation aggregation is in
    troduced as an abstraction which is important in
    conceptualizing the real world. aggregation transforms a
    relationship between objects into a higher-level object. a new
    data type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
    certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies aggregation
    abstractions. relational databases defined as collections of
    aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n-ary relations. to
    main tain well-definedness, update operations on such databases
    must preserve two invariants. well-defined relations are
    distinct from relations in third normal form. it is shown that
    these notions are complementary and both are important in
    database design. a top-down methodology for database design is
    described which separates decisions concerning aggregate
    structure from decisions concerning key identification. it is
    suggested that aggregate types, and other types which support
    real-world abstractions without in troducing implementation
    detail, should be incorporated into programming languages.

    <text>libraries in colleges of higher education. a decline in

    <text>automatic generation of efficient lexical processors
    using finite state techniques the practical application of the
    theory of finite-state automata to automatically generate
    lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article by
    the use of the aed rword system, developed at m.i.t. as part of
    the aed-1 system. this system accepts as input description of
    the multicharacter items or of words allowable in a language
    given in terms of a subset of regular expressions. the output
    of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string of
    characters and combines them into the items as defined by the
    regular expressions. each output item is identified by a code
    number together with a pointer to a block of storage containing
    the characters and character count in the item. the processors
    produced by the system are based on finite-state machines. each
    state of a "machine" corresponds to a unique condition in the
    lexical processing of a character string. at each state a
    character is read, and the machine changes to a new state. at
    each transition appropriate actions are taken based on the
    particular character read. the system has been in operation
    since 1966, and processors generated have compared favorably in
    speed to carefully hand-coded programs to accomplish the same
    task. lexical processors for aed-o and mad are among the many
    which have been produced. the techniques employed are
    independent of the nature of the items being evaluated. if the
    word "events" is substituted for character string, these
    processors may be described as generalized decision-making
    mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence of events. this
    allows the system to be used in a range of applications outside
    the area of lexical processing. however convenient these
    advantages may be, speed is the most important consideration.
    in designing a system for automatic generation of a lexical
    processor, the goal was a processor which completely eliminated
    backup or rereading, which was nearly as fast as hand-coded
    processors, which would analyze the language and detect errors,
    and which would be convenient and easy to use. december, 1968

    for a lending system was used. the introduction of the
    automated process in the 1st 2 stages of the plan was very
    successful and led to preparations being made for other
    libraries in tubingen and karlsruhe to adopt the system. the
    3rd phase will be completed by the beginning of 1982. the
    computerised lending system led to an increase in lending from
    350,000 in 1975 to 700,000 in 1980 which reflects a
    considerable improvement in the library user service.</text>

    <text>on the relative efficiencies of context-free grammar
    recognizers a number of diverse recognition procedures that
    have been proposed for parsing sentences with respect to a
    context-free grammar are described in this paper by means of a
    common device. each procedure is defined by giving an algorithm
    for obtaining a nondeterministic turing machine recognizer that
    is equivalent to a given context-free grammar. the
    formalization of the turing machine has been chosen to make
    possible particularly simple description of the parsing
    procedures considered. an attempt has been made to compare
    recognition efficiencies for the procedures defined. for a few
    simple grammars and sentences a formal comparison has been
    made. empirical comparison of the recognition of more realistic
    programming languages such as lisp and algol has been made by
    means of a program which simulates the turing machine on the
    univac m-460 computer. several algorithms for producing
    grammars equivalent to a given context-free grammar have been
    considered, and the increase in recognition efficiency they
    afford has been empirically investigated. may, 1965 griffiths,

    concerned with both the effects of computers on society and the
    responsibilities of computer scientists to society. the impact
    of computers is divided into five components: political,
    economic, cultural, social, and moral; the main part of the
    paper defines each component and presents examples of the
    relevant issues. in the remaining portions the possible formats
    for such a course are discussed, a topic by topic outline is
    given, and a selected set of references is listed. it is hoped
    that the proposal will make it easier to initiate courses on
    this subject. april, 1972 horowitz, e. morgan, h. l. shaw, a.

    <text>a vector space model for automatic indexing in a document
    retrieval, or other pattern matching environment where stored
    entities (documents) are compared with each other or with
    incoming patterns (search requests), it appears that the best
    indexing (property) space is one where each entity lies as far
    away from the others as possible; in these circumstances the
    value of an indexing system may be expressible as a function of
    the density of the object space; in particular, retrieval
    performance may correlate inversely with space density. an
    approach based on space density computations is used to choose
    an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents.
    typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating the
    usefulness of the model. november, 1975 salton, g. wong, a.

    <text>information transfer' a conceptual model for

    with implications for library education. contribution to an
    issue devoted to education for technological university library
    work. traditionally, there are 5 basic functions which the
    library and librarianship perform for society-archival,
    cultural, educational, recreational and informational.
    unfortunately, library education, while giving lip-service to
    the other functions, has remained preoccupied with the archival
    activities. proposes a theoretical model of information
    transfer. the respective roles of librarians, information
    scientists and information managers are identified within this
    model in the context of the 5 functions discussed above.
    implications for curriculum design are discussed.
    recommendations for programmes of study based on a common core,
    but with distinct areas of specialisation for students training
    for the 3 professional fields, are presented.</text>

    <text>a set of basic input-output procedures (algorithm 335
    [15]) by means of the primitives in symbol, outsymbol and
    length, as requested by this journal's algorithms policy [comm.
    acm 10 (nov. 67), 729] a basic set of input-output procedures
    is defined aiming at quality and flexibility. outreal, for
    instance, is written as a derived procedure; it outputs using
    the fixed point or the floating point representation, and
    rounds properly. variants can easily be written because of the
    explicit call of the procedures decompose integer and decompose
    real. the highly recommended practice of echoing input is made
    easy with one subset of derived procedures (ioi, ior, iob,
    ioa). the documentation of output in the form of equivalent
    algol statements is also provided when use is made of the
    subset oti, otr, otb, ota. the berkeley style of providing
    information on the form of output using prior calls of
    procedures such as real format is defined. a use of the
    parameter outchannel to provide information for simultaneous
    output to several channels is suggested. interrelationship
    between the declared procedures is furnished in tabular form.

    <text>conversational access to a 2048-word machine lap6 is an
    on-line system running on a 2048-word linc which provides full
    facilities for text editing, automatic filing and file
    maintenance, and program preparation and assembly. it focuses
    on the preparation and editing of continuously displayed
    23,040-character text strings (manuscripts) which can be
    positioned anywhere by the user and edited by simply adding and
    deleting lines as though working directly on an elastic scroll.
    other features are available through a uniform command set
    which itself can be augmented by the user. the machine,
    although small, aids program design by providing display scope
    and premarked randomly addressable linc tapes as standard
    items, in an environment similar to that of a sophisticated
    terminal. the tapes are logically similar to a disk. priority
    was given to the design of efficient tape algorithms to
    minimize the limitations of the small memory. techniques
    developed for handling scroll editing, filing, and the layered
    system structure are outlined. lap6 is used by about 2000
    people in 11 countries. its design was strongly influenced by
    performance criteria established in interviews held with linc
    users themselves during the specification period. july, 1970

    <text>the use of automated data processing in libraries' ideas
    for a new viewpoint. although librarians formerly adopted a
    defensive attitude when introducing automated data processing,
    its use resulted in ergonomic improvements and more interesting
    work for some staff. the use of automated data processing can,
    however, cause stress and monotony, the control of work and
    human potential by machines, increased isolation of
    individuals, the downgrading of some library posts and the loss
    of a friendly atmosphere for readers. if the human touch is to
    be retained in libraries, new standards are required. good
    communication must be developed between staff members and
    between staff and readers. staff work must be reorganised and
    the tendency to gigantism in the use of automation
    avoided.</text>

    <text>is "sometime" sometimes better than "always"?
    (intermittent assertions in proving program correctness) this
    paper explores a technique for proving the correctness and
    termination of programs simultaneously. this approach, the
    intermittent-assertion method, involves documenting the program
    with assertions that must be true at some time when control
    passes through the corresponding point, but that need not be
    true every time. the method, introduced by burstall, promises
    to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional
    methods. the intermittent-assertion method is presented with a
    number of examples of correctness and termination proofs. some
    of these proofs are markedly simpler than their conventional
    counterparts. on the other hand, it is shown that a proof of
    correctness or termination by any of the conventional
    techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using
    intermittent assertions. finally, it is shown how the
    intermittent-assertion method can be applied to prove the
    validity of program transformations and the correctness of
    continuously operating programs. february, 1978 manna, z.

    de roer, head of the library section at the dutch ministry of
    culture, recreation and social services represent a serious
    threat to the future of public libraries in the netherlands. in
    spite of government assurances that access to information
    should be available to all sections of the public, van de roer
    is clearly in favour of increasing membership charges for
    public libraries in an effort to reduce government spending.
    librarians must convince the authorities that public library
    services should be regarded as part of a national information

    are produced by photo ionization and removed by ionic
    recombination or attachment ot neutral atoms and molecules and
    that the ionizing radiation is distributed uniformly over the
    visible disk of the sun it is deduced that the electron loss
    rate is consistent with an ionic recombination process in the
    layer the attachment and recombination coefficients decrease
    with increasing height their variations during the eclipse are
    related to the vertical movements of the ionosphere seasonal
    variations between effects observed in a number of eclipses are
    explained in terms of different degrees of superposition of the
    and layers the existence of secondary minima of electron
    density is interpreted as indicating that a distinction must be

    bibliographic control to avoid duplication of publication and
    research. discusses briefly the factors influencing the
    generation of information in this field, where the literature
    is increasing rapidly. comprehensive details are given of the
    available bibliographic tools, with particular reference to
    projects initiated by the brazilian institute for scientific
    and technical information (ibict), as well as bibliographic
    publications issued by research institutes and university
    library schools. the bibliographic relevance of theses,
    periodical catalogues, and research directories is examined,

    palace of the grand dukes of baden was opened to the public as
    a cultural centre. the work of adapting the 19th century
    building for this purpose began in 1978. on the ground floor is
    the library for children and young people, containing 30,000
    volumes which were moved here when premises in the municipal
    library became too small. the 1st floor houses the municipal
    art gallery, specialising in german paintings from 1850 onwards
    and the 2nd floor the local history collection. there are also
    rooms for meetings, film shows and painting sessions, offices,
    a cafeteria and a media centre containing over 3,000 cassettes
    and records. since its opening the centre has achieved
    increases in loans, readers and visitors to the art

    <text>centralised book distribution-a topic of the day. a

    supply libraries, especially public libraries, with literature
    and up-to-date equipment. enterprise of that kind had been
    envisaged already in the statute for the national network of
    libraries in bulgaria. similar organisations have been in
    operation in other socialist countries. they are of invaluable
    assistance to librarians, in particular those in small
    libraries, who very often lack the necessary qualifications in
    librarianship and work only part-time. books are selected,
    purchased and distributed to libraries almost immediately after
    they have been published, the catalogue cards with appropriate
    annotations being delivered at the same time. thus, new
    acquisitions are selected expertly to maintain the proper ratio
    between political, fictional and special material. librarians
    are by these means relieved of the tedious and time-consuming
    task of cataloguing, and can devote more time to their readers,
    to their ideological education and to professional
    advancement.</text>

    for women. surveys the social background, the historical
    background up to the 1920s, the qualifications and personal
    characteristics required of women in librarianship, as well as
    their part in library associations. women first became accepted
    in librarianship when there were insufficient numbers of men
    available. the women, mostly from the middle class, rushed into
    a profession which did not detract from social prestige.
    stereotyped ideas concerning female qualities made their
    entrance into the profession easier' accuracy, industry,
    self-denial and subordination on the one hand; social
    sensitivity, motherly feeling and insight into people's nature
    on the other. the growing number of women in librarianship made
    an organ for the representation of their interests desirable.
    the 'vereinigung bibliotekarisch arbeitender frauen', founded
    in 1907, made efforts to improve payment, inform interested
    people about the profession and about ed ucation for
    librarianship, and provided an employment agency. the
    association was dissolved into the 'reichsverband deutscher
    bibliotheksbeamter und-angestellter' in 1920.</text>

    <text>an idea of librarianship: an outline for a root-metaphor
    theory in library science. paper presented at library history
    seminar vi 'libraries &amp; culture', austin, texas, 19-22 mar
    80. with growth comes complexity; and librarianship becomes
    increasingly complex as it grows. a 2-fold approach to the
    understanding of librarianship is suggested. firstly,
    librarianship should be viewed as a general discipline and its
    characteristics should be studied as a whole, and secondly,
    basic components of librarianship should be identified, by
    reducing the complexity of the field to its simplest parts-its
    'roots'. proposes a model of 'metalibrarianship' based on this
    analysis, and involving assumptions about its nature in terms
    of the mechanism, expanded contextualism and formism, and
    suggesting that the primary root metaphor of metalibrarianship
    is the relationship between the generic book, its subject
    matter, and its reader.</text>

    <text>the norwegian dewey committee-what do they really do?.
    the norwegian dewey committee was established by the state
    library service and the national library office to advise on
    dewey classification in norway. its new geographical tables
    (suggestions, not instructions), aim to help, for instance,
    libraries with large local collections. basically they follow
    ddc 19, dividing norway into 4 main sections (as against the
    earlier arnesen division into 3) with further divisions by
    county, district and local authority. comments from libraries
    were invited: 1 suggestion that arnesen notation should be
    retained for north norway has been accepted for future us
    editions. a new edition of arnesen (the current norwegian
    version of dewey, based on ddc 17) is being undertaken by the
    norwegian library association. there will be major changes in
    the 300 classes, corresponding to ddc 19. supplementary tables,
    notes and indexes will be improved, and libraries will be able
    to classify broadly or more precisely as required.</text>

    <text>catalogues on film. describes chicago public library's
    automation system. in 1974 the library joined the oclc network
    and today all technical departments are automated. the users
    meet automation through the com catalogue (computer output
    microfilm), a system regarded as much cheaper than an on-line
    catalogue. there were many teething troubles involved in the
    initial use of the catalogue, particularly in the branch
    libraries, and the automated acquisition system led to a very
    tight budget control over the branches. although new editions
    of the com catalogue take longer to arrive than promised it has
    led to improved interlending service. the public, however,
    continue to use the old discontinued card catalogue as, it was
    claimed, they are not interested in the library service's total
    holdings, but only in the stock of the library branch used. the
    staff, too, despite lack of organised opposition, expressed
    criticism of the automation programme.</text>

    <text>an algorithm for the construction of bounded-context
    parsers an algorithm is described which accepts an arbitrary
    context-free grammar and constructs a bounded-context parser
    for it whenever such a parser exists. in the first part of the
    paper the definition of a context-free grammar and the working
    of a bounded-context parser are recalled. the notion of
    reduction class for a context-free grammar is then introduced
    and its connection with the structure of a bounded-context
    parser is indicated. next, pushdown automata which generate the
    different reduction classes of a context-free grammar are
    defined. finally, the algorithm is described; it essentially
    carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the
    pushdown automata generating the reduction classes. in the
    second part, the utility of the algorithm is discuss ed in the
    light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design.
    the algorithm is claimed to be particularly useful in the
    simultaneous design of a language and a compiler for it. may,

    <text>information services to trade, industry and the
    professions. the large public library, such as the johannesburg
    public library, south africa, that is situated in an area with
    many special libraries, can provide an information service to
    the general public who are without access to the special
    libraries. such a library can often provide reference material
    which is not specialised enough for the special library while
    not popular enough for the smaller public library. at least
    some information sources on a very wide range of subjects are
    required. the library staff cannot be experts on all these
    fields. they consequently refer users to information sources
    and expect users to do their own searching. users often fall in
    the small business category and are without libraries of their
    own. the information they need may sometimes not be available
    in a form applicable to the south african situation. the
    johannesburg public library serves as a depository for the
    journals received by many scientific a nd technical societies
    in johannesburg, and in some cases the library manages and
    maintains the library of a society within the jpl building.

    725,000 requests were made in 1979. most requests are satisfied
    through union catalogues or printed union lists. in addition to
    the 12 provincial centres, the 13 regional support libraries
    have a central role in the regional supply system; they
    received 131,708 requests in 1980 and satisfied 27%. a single
    centre in each region is recommended. a survey of the national
    system showed that 40% of all requests at this level came from
    academic libraries, 40% from special libraries and 20% from
    public libraries. most requests are for science and technology
    (60%), for english language material (55% of all requests; 70%
    of requests for journals), and for more recent material (65%
    published in the last 10 years). the satisfaction rate was 76%
    (higher for req uests sent to union catalogues): 1/2 were

    coverage were identified. an on-line national union catalogue

    will still be necessary, and charges should be made. improved

    of 19,000 sq.m. for the new building required to ease the space
    shortage. the data processing plant has been enlarged and
    improved and is now linked with euronet diane. there was a
    record total stock growth of 13.8%. main stock increases
    occurred for maps, literature by german authors exiled in the
    1930's, dissertations, music scores and microform publications.
    the library's cataloguing rules have been adapted to the rak
    (german alphabetical cataloguing rules) for academic libraries;
    production of the deutsche bibliographie (german national
    bibliography) has shown wider coverage and improvement in
    procedures. over 139,000 requests for material were made by
    about 10,000 readers. the library organised several exhibitions

    <text>the influence of computerised iud-databases on the
    structure of service programmes in academic libraries. since
    the 1970s on-line data bases covering a variety of subjects
    have started to be installed in academic libraries. these
    libraries should be considering how data bases can be used now
    and in the future to improve their service programme structure.
    most data bases cannot be used directly by library users and
    specially trained staff are necessary. it is also important to
    differentiate between the massive range of information services
    now available. the introduction of data bases providing
    immediate access to literature references means that methods of
    increasing the speed of access to the literature itself should
    also be developed.</text>

    <text>a scan conversion algorithm with reduced storage
    requirements most graphics systems using a raster scan output
    device (crt or hardcopy) maintain a display file in the xy or
    random scan format. scan converters, hardware or software, must
    be provided to translate the picture description from the xy
    format to the raster format. published scan conversion
    algorithms which are fast will reserve a buffer area large
    enough to accommodate the entire screen. on the other hand,
    those which use a small buffer area are slow because they
    require multiple passes through the xy display file. the scan
    conversion algorithm described here uses a linked list data
    structure to process the lines of the drawing in strips
    corresponding to groups of scan lines. a relatively small
    primary memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary
    image for a group of scan lines. when this portion of the
    drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for the next
    portion. because of the list processing procedures used, only a
    single pass through the xy display file is required when
    generating the binary image and only a slight increase in
    execution time over the fully buffered core results. results
    slow that storage requirements can be reduced by more than 80
    percent while causing less than a 10 percent increase in
    execution time. november, 1973 jordan, b. w. jr. barrett, r. c.

    <text>on multiprogramming, machine coding, and computer
    organization the author feels that the interrupt feature which
    is available in most modern computers is a potent source of
    programming pitfalls and errors, and that it therefore may
    heavily contribute to the unreliability of programs making use
    of it. a programming scheme is presented which avoids the
    concept of the interrupt and permits the specification of
    concurrent (or pseudoconcurrent) activities in a supposedly
    more perspicuous manner. it is intended to serve as a basis for
    the construction of operating systems, which are prime examples
    of programs with concurrent activities. the scheme includes a
    set of basic instructions for the generation, termination, and
    synchronization of parallel processes. a set of routines
    representing these instructions and thereby simulating a
    hypothetical machine organization has been implemented and test
    on the ibm system/360. two programs using these instructions,
    written in pl360, are presented. september, 1969 wirth, n.

    empirical analyses and analytic studies based on applying this
    methodology to an actual multiaccess in teractive system are
    reported. relations between workload variables such as memory
    requirement distribution and job swap time, and performance
    measures such as response time and memory utilization are
    graphically displayed. a multiphase, analytically soluble model

    excessive amounts of trivial material as much as the elitist
    approach but the illiteracy of some sections of the public is
    preferable to the total abstinence of the non-reader. the
    public library must bring a new quality to its public service,
    exercising a corrective function in respect of book market
    trends. librarians must mount an offensive action in pursuit of
    the sensible, social and humane aspects of their service. it is
    dangerous to attach too much importance to statistics.

    states that no material 'harmful to children' may be located
    where children might read, and thus effectively prohibits
    adults from the same material unless bookstores bar admittance
    to under-18s. despite the us constitution and bill of rights,

    was carried out to investigate the information habits and needs
    of the agricultural researches in the english-speaking
    countries of the caribbean region with particular emphasis on
    the use of agrindex. the survey revealed that agrindex is used
    by and known to only a small number of researchers and possible
    reasons for this are discussed. from all indications it seems
    that there is a need for an information service which would
    provide abstracts and reviews of regional agricultural
    literature as well as information on research in progress. two
    recommendations are made; one for the development of a user
    education programme which would ensure wider use of agrindex

    <text>on the provision of information for the use of
    microelectronics in a factory combine. microelectronics have a
    strong influence over most contemporary industrial working
    processes, including not only the flow of material, energy and
    information but also general organisation and management. thus
    it is clear that the staff of specialist research organisations
    have a greater need than ever before of a comprehensive range
    of information. examples of this need and suggestions for its
    rational satisfaction are presented with reference to
    experiences in a strip steel factory concerning the use of
    microelectronics in industrial production, scientific research,
    financial calculations, statistics and management. the use of
    microelectronics is still in its infancy; its potential in
    large scale information storage and dissemination is not yet

    fell from one-third to 10-15%. library loans increased
    sevenfold during 1945-70, while borrowers increased from 8% to
    26% of population. the first mobile library appeared in 1961;
    by 1971 there were 73, lending 8% of the national total.

    distinctive features of the design were the use of capabilities
    for protection, and the organization of the system into a
    sequence of layers, each building on the facilities provided by
    earlier ones and protecting itself from the malfunctions of
    later ones. there were serious problems in maintaining the

    led to increased pressure on the existing services with the

    <text>performance of systems used for data transmission
    transfer rate of information bits -an asa tutorial standard
    information thruput as a characteristic of systems performance
    is discussed. this discussion includes the pertinent aspects of
    information transfer, of determination of transfer rate of
    information bits (trib), of residual errors, and of standard
    measurement conditions. the paper also presents an orderly
    arrangement of characteristics and parameters that affect
    information thruput, and some examples on procedures for
    determining a thruput rate in terms of trib. it concludes that
    a performance characteristic involving information rate can
    best be expressed as the trib in conjunction with the residual
    error rate. may, 1965 ca650504 jb march 7, 1978 3:10 pm</text>

    <text>a mathematical programming updating method using modified
    givens transformations and applied to lp problems an efficient
    and numerically stable method is presented for the problem of
    updating an orthogonal decomposition of a matrix of column (or
    row) vectors. the fundamental idea is to add a column (or row)
    analogous to adding an additional row of data in a linear least
    squares problem. a column (or row) is dropped by a formal
    scaling with the imaginary unit, -1, followed by least squares
    addition of the column (or row). the elimination process for
    the procedure is successive ssive application of the givens
    transformation in modified (more efficient) form. these ideas
    are illustrated with an implementation of the revised simplex
    method. the algorithm is a general purpose one that does not
    account for any particular structure or sparsity in the
    equations. some suggested computational tests for determining
    signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex
    algorithm are mentioned. a simple means of constructing test
    cases and some sample computing times are presented. april,

    19th century, several learned societies amalgamated their
    libraries with it; the stocks, comprising works in natural
    sciences and medicine, were available for use by local doctors
    and members of the newly formed association. in 1907 the
    library was opened to the public; new premises were used and
    professional staff employed. after a period of financial
    difficulty during world war i, the johann-wolfgang-goethe
    university took over financial control of the library. in 1947
    a new agreement was made, giving the university more powers in
    library administration and in 1966 the library was moved into
    new premises with the university library.</text>

    <text>computer generation of gamma random variates with
    non-integral shape parameters when the shape parameter, a, is
    integral, generating gamma random variables with a digital
    computer is straightforward. there is no simple method for
    generating gamma random variates with non-integral shape
    parameters. a common procedure is to approximately generate
    such random variables by use of the so-called probability
    switch method. another procedure, which is exact, is due to
    johnk. this paper presents a rejection method for exactly
    generating gamma random variables when a is greater than 1. the
    efficiency of the rejection method is shown to be better than
    the efficiency of johnk's method. the paper concludes that when
    a is non-integral the following mix of procedures yields the
    best combination of accuracy and efficiency: (1) when a is less
    than 1, use johnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than a and a is
    less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when a is greater
    than 5, use the probability switch method. december,1974

    <text>reconstruction of pictures from their projections there
    are situations in the natural sciences and medicine (e.g. in
    electron microscopy and x-ray photography) in which it is
    desirable to estimate the gray levels of a digital picture at
    the individual points from the sums of the gray levels along
    straight lines (projections) at a few angles. usually, in such
    situations, the picture is far from determined and the problem
    is to find the "most representative" picture. three algorithms
    are described (all using monte carlo methods) which were
    designed to solve this problem. the algorithms are applicable
    in a large and varied number of fields. the most important uses
    may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles from
    electron micrographs and three-dimensional x-ray analysis.

    obtain approximations with a small error, much more than in the

    <text>cold-start vs. warm-start miss ratios in a two-level
    computer storage hierarchy, miss ratio measurements are often
    made from a "cold start," that is made with the first-level
    store initially empty. for large capacities the effect on the
    measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the
    first-level store can be significant, even for long reference
    strings. use of "warm-start" rather than "cold-start" miss
    ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed
    "s-shape" of lifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus
    capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs
    that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage. on
    the other hand, if cold-start miss ratios are measured as a
    function of capacity and measurement length, then they are
    useful in studying systems in which operation of a program is
    periodically interrupted by task switches. it is shown how to
    obtain, under simple assumptions, the cache miss ratio for
    multiprogramming from cold-start miss ratio values and how to
    obtain approximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start miss

    brazilian village at the turn of the century where only 3 books
    are available, contrasting the cultural deprivation of the

    depicted in european fiction. considers the distorted view of
    reality presented by the 3 books in combination, and comments
    on this inadequacy of literary provision as typical of the

    <text>sabrag, a time-sharing low-cost computer the serial
    sabrac computer designed and built in the scientific department
    of the israel defense ministry has a 5000-location magnetic
    drum, main store. to avoid a need to resort to optimum
    programming techniques and to increase its overall efficiency
    the computer has also been given a 224-word ferrite core store
    from which the program is obeyed. transfers between the core
    and drum stores and to and from the twin paper-tape input and
    output channels are all available autonomously (concurrently,
    time-shared). multiplication and division orders are also
    autonomous, so that the machine may be executing up to three
    orders simultaneously. all functions naturally are interlocked.
    a number of other advanced orders and facilities are also
    incorporated.in particular, an "execute" order permits a
    temporary jump for up to four orders and a second modifier
    register permits double modification in general and relative
    addressing of subroutines in particular. thus the overall
    effective speed of the machine is muchhigher than its basic
    specification would lead one to expect and its design indicates
    one way in which the concepts of time sharing may be
    incorporated in "low-cost" computers. august, 1963 lehman, m.

    is a danger of introducing new barriers into interlingual

    being familiar with top management's expectations despite the

    <text>operations on generalized arrays with the genie compiler
    operations on vectors, matrices, and higher dimensional storage
    arrays are standard features of most compilers today. the
    elements of such structures are usually restricted to be
    scalars. for many sophisticated applications this restriction
    can impose cumbersome data representations. an efficient system
    has been devised and implemented which allows the elements of
    multidimensional arrays to themselves be multidimensional
    arrays. this system was developed from a storage structure in
    which the location, length, and content of each array is
    described by a codeword which can be interpreted by the system.
    code words may describe arrays containing more codewords, thus
    providing all needed descriptive information for
    hyperstructures of any form. may, 1970 sitton, g. a.

    <text>high speed compilation of efficient object code a
    three-pass compiler with the following properties is briefly
    described: the last two passes scan an intermediate language
    produced by the preceding pass in essentially the reverse of
    the order in which it was generated, so that the first pass is
    the only one which hasto read the bulky problem-oriented input.
    the double scan, one in either direction, performed by the
    first two passes, allows the compiler to remove locally
    constant expressions and recursively calculable expressions
    from loops and to do the important part of common subexpression
    recognition. optimization such as the effective use of index
    registers, although as important, is not discussed since the
    object code which would be most efficient is highly machine
    dependent. the discussion is in terms of a fortran-like
    language, although the technique is applicable to most
    algebraic languages. august, 1965 gear, c. w. ca650801 jb march

    catalogue support until recently, but there are new pilot
    projects on acquisitions, on-line circulation control, and
    on-line catalogue enquiries. utlas can also provide data to
    feed other computer systems. the ultimate goal is to offer
    libraries a complete service in direct competition with other

    report of a brazilian study based on postgraduate course work

    previous studies of consistency and formulas developed to test
    and measure both inter and intraconsistency. details are given
    of the methodology used here in a restricted study involving 10
    indexers and 1 article, and results presented in full, showing
    the number of terms assigned in relation to length of time
    spent; consistency between terms; and frequency of use of

    in 1944 to 50,000 volumes today. acquisitions are based on an
    annual thematical plan, the highest % being socio-political
    literature (26,3%) followed by children's books (25,7%) and
    books on arts (24,7%). circulation and book processing methods
    are also discussed. 1 of the main functions of the library is
    the provision of methodological guidance to smaller libraries
    in its area including town, village and school libraries. this
    is done through library seminars and the publication of
    methodological materials. practical help is provided by
    librarians-methodologists who travel to the smaller libraries

    classification of gravitational fields in this note, an

    algebraic invariants of the weyl tensor which permits the
    determination of the bel-petrov types of a gravitational field.
    this algorithm, although more specialized than that of
    d'inverno and russell-clark, requires neither the use of a
    special coordinate system nor the spin coefficient formalism.
    the algorithm has been implemented in formac and is designed to
    complete the classification scheme proposed by petrov in his
    book. an appendix contains examples illustrating the use of the

    according to a report issued in april 81 by the research
    secretariat, denmark lags behind other european countries in
    its support for research, both public and private. the report
    deals separately with research libraries and describes the
    consequences of the cuts both for libraries and their mother
    institutions; it shows that the libraries use less than 10% of
    the expenditure on research. includes comments on the report by
    the executive committee of the joint council of research
    libraries. the committee supports the conclusion that the
    research libraries' economic problems should be solved in
    conjunction with, and preferably before, any change in their
    structure and management. it points out that figures for
    running costs of research libraries under the cultural

    <text>on complement division the division algorithm theorem is

    remainder in complement form. algorithms for division yielding
    complement results are derived for numbers represented in any
    base greater than one. both radix and radix-less-one
    complementation schemes are considered. the binary form of the
    algorithms thus includes both two's and one's complement
    implementation. the problem of quotient overflow for complement

    <text>topological sorting of large networks topological sorting
    is a procedure required for many problems involving analysis of

    paper presents a very general method for obtaining topological
    order. it permits treatment of larger networks than can be
    handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater
    efficiency. although the procedure can be adapted to any
    machine, it is discussed in terms of the 7090. a pert network
    of 30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one hour of
    machine time. the method was developed as a byproduct of
    procedures needed by westinghouse, baltimore. it has not been
    programmed and at present there are no plans to implement it.
    in regard to the techniques described, westinghouse's present
    and anticipated needs are completely served by the lockheed
    program, which is in current use. november, 1962 kahn, a. b.

    formats and search capabilities of dialog, orbit and brs. 60
    students are taught each term; the course is offered 3 times
    annually. the students attend a lecture and a 2 hour supervised
    laboratory session each week. the lectures are structured to
    give the students an overview of various aspects of the
    computer-based information profession. the laboratory sessions
    are of prime importance because throughout the course emphasis
    is placed on learning the systems by being on-line. each
    student has the use of a terminal during the laboratory
    session; and consequently is on-line a minimum of 30 hours per

    <text>compressed tries this paper presents a new data
    structure, called a compressed trie or c-trie, to be used in
    information retrieval systems. it has the same underlying m-ary
    tree structure as a trie, where m is a parameter of the trie,
    but whereas the fields of the nodes in a trie have to be large
    enough to hold a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a
    c-trie are only one bit long. in the analysis part of the paper
    it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the retrieval
    time, measured in terms of bit inspections of one key, is of
    the order logm(n) and the storage requirement of the order
    n*(m+log2 n) bits. this improvement in storage requirements and
    retrieval time is achieved at the cost of decreasing the
    flexibility of the structure, and therefore updating costs are
    increased. first the c-trie is analyzed as a data structure,
    and then several methods of its use for relatively static
    databases are discussed. july, 1976 maly, k. data structure,

    <text>electron lattice scattering technique for citation
    analysis and evaluating the impact of research papers.
    introduces a physical model for measuring the impact of
    research contribution based on scattering of electrons by the
    lattice atoms. describes scattering as a stochastic process and
    adopts an analogous situation in which lattice atoms and
    electrons have been replaced by a system of research papers and
    potential citers respectively. in the construction of the above
    model, the authors have made a number of simplifications and
    assumptions and developed an absorption index activity to be

    these utterances were recorded at the normal noise level of the

    in any manner. a sequence of operations defined on the speech
    wave selects a list of points along the waveform as candidates

    <text>survey of the periodical stock at the library of the
    institute of public health. the growth of the hungarian
    institute of public health's objectives and research team, the
    lack of space and the rise in journal prices induced the
    librarians to examine the usage of journals. they wished to
    establish journals which need not be subscribed to any longer;
    journals which could be placed in remote storage; and journals
    which readers regularly require but which are not available in
    the library. data were collected from 1 nov 77 -30 apr 78. as a
    result of the investigation it can be laid down that the
    library can comply, from its own stock, with a large part of
    readers' demands for journals. the smaller part (29%) of the
    stock fulfils 77% of demands, the larger proportion is little
    used. the number of journals not used at all is small. journals
    used less will be put in distant stacks; current journals and
    often used volumes will be stored in the library.</text>

    files are stored on 2x300 megabyte discs. since hull had no
    existing machine-readable catalogue, a full record of all stock
    had to be compiled. the automated circulation control system at
    present operates only on a small section of the stock, but it
    is hoped to extend this to all classes. economic stringency
    obliged hull to discard its flexible and effective manual
    system and replace it with an efficient and easily-used system.
    geac fulfilled the university's needs, and the partial system
    operating at present meets hull's requirements.</text>

    <text>an experimental model of system/360 the problem of
    predicting the performance of modern computer systems is
    formidable. one general technique which can ease this problem
    is macroscopic simulation. this paper reports on the
    applicability of that technique to system/360. the paper
    describes an experimental model of system/360-its hardware,
    software, and its environment. the measures of system
    performance produced by the model consist of statistics
    relating to turnaround time, throughput, hardware utilization,
    software utilization, and queueing processes. the model is
    mechanized in simscript and consists of some 1750 statements.

    postulate-based permuted subject indexing (popsi) has been
    developed through the interpretation of the structure of sils
    forming part of the general theory. the classaurus has also
    been formulated; this is a faceted systematic scheme of

    1968 as successor to the bond van christelijke openbare
    leeszalen en bibliotheken (association of christian public
    reading rooms and libraries). the aim of the centre was to
    promote the formation of a network of protestant-oriented
    public libraries throughout the country. however, at the time
    of the centre's foundation a number of librarians had proposed
    that a single national organisation free from religious bias be
    created to supervise library affairs in the netherlands. as a
    result of the proposals the nederlands bibliotheek en lectuur
    centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) was formed
    in 1972. the clc was absorbed into the new organisation as a
    separate sub-group and through the nblc has been able to
    promote the position of the protestant church in library

    institutional and government libraries). the function of the
    swedish national library is held by the royal library; the
    coordinating role rests with the council of research libraries.
    the tendency toward centralisation resulted, in 1975, in the

    <text>the restriction language for computer grammars of natural
    language over the past few years, a number of systems for the
    computer analysis of natural language sentences have been based
    on augmented context-free grammars: a context-free grammar
    which defines a set of parse trees for a sentence, plus a group
    of restrictions to which a tree must conform in order to be a
    valid sentence analysis. as the coverage of the grammar is
    increased, an efficient representation becomes essential for
    further development. this paper presents a programming language
    designed specifically for the compact and perspicuous statement
    of restrictions of a natural language grammar. it is based on
    ten years' experience parsing text sentences with the
    comprehensive english grammar of the n.y.u. linguistic string
    project, and embodies in its syntax and routines the relations
    which were found to be useful and adequate for computerized
    natural language analysis. the language is used in the current
    implementation of the linguistic string parser. july 1975

    for monograph purchase in 1980, a budget only exceeded by 17

    <text>a use of fast and slow memories in list-processing

    increase in memory space utilized to store list-structured
    data. it consists in reducing to one level a nonhomogeneous
    store composed of fast (core) and slow (disk or drum) memories.
    the space available in slow memory is divided into pages each
    containing a given number of machine words. the reduction to a
    one-level memory is performed by a program which leaves the
    most often called pages in the fast memory. when a new page
    from slow store is requested, the page in core having the
    longest period of inactivity is transferred back to the slow
    store. the complete scheme has been implemented in connection
    with a lisp embedding into algol, using an ibm 7044 with 32k of
    core memory and disks. gains in memory space were about
    100-fold. as often happens in programming applications the
    price of the additional space is computer time. although the
    disks have an access time 10^4 times slower than core, tests
    indicate that the actual slow down varied from 3 to 10,
    depending on the number of pages available in the fast store.

    <text>protection in operating systems a model of protection
    mechanisms in computing systems is presented and its

    systems under this model is to determine in a given situation
    whether a subject can acquire a particular right to an object.
    in restricted cases, it can be shown that this problem is
    decidable, i.e. there is an algorithm to determine whether a
    system in a particular configuration is safe. in general, and
    under surprisingly weak assumptions, it cannot be decided if a
    situation is safe. various implications of this fact are

    <text>how can we use library research?. introductions to a
    debate held at the 14th nordic library meeting in stockholm aug
    80. o. harbo distinguishes 4 types of library research and
    their uses. the most important is research in the library
    professional area, i.e. research into acquisition, storing and
    retrieval of information. the results can be used directly, or
    indirectly for the educational benefit of the person carrying
    out the research. many large development projects can only be
    carried out by central library bodies. m. okko points to the
    dangers of library research which is carried out for its
    usefulness only and iis directed by outside interests. the
    theoretical results of basic library science must permeate the
    professional thinking and practice. b. quentzer detects a
    mistrust of scientific thinking in libraries. education for
    librarianship must be changed so that it is more problem
    orientated and critical, thus an interest in library research
    can be built up. includes contributions to the debate by g.

    <text>sentence paraphrasing from a conceptual base a model of
    natural language based on an underlying language-free
    representation of meaning is described. a program based on this
    model is able to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate
    understanding with respect to a given context. this generator
    operates in conjunction with a natural language analyzer and a
    combined memory and inference model. in generating sentences
    from meaning structures, the program employs both the
    information retrieval and deduction capabilities of the memory
    model. the model encompasses several diverse classes of
    linguistic knowledge, which include: (1) executable tests of
    conceptual properties stored in discrimination nets; (2)
    information relating conceptual to syntactic roles, stored in a
    word-sense dictionary, and (3) surface grammatical knowledge,
    stored in a formal grammar. february, 1975 goldman, n. m.

    <text>a method for incrementally compiling languages with
    nested statement structure a method of incremental compilation
    is presented which applies especially to programming languages
    in which statements can be nested (such as algol and pl/i). the
    method permits editing of the source language using a general
    purpose text editor, and incremental processing of changes
    without frequent recompilation of entire routines. the
    essential points of the method are: (1) the syntax of the
    language is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur
    on lines; (2) an internal data structure (called the skeleton)
    is maintained to represent the statement structure; (3) the
    recompilation is partially batched in the sense that
    recompilation of modified lines does not occur until the last
    of a set of editing commands has been received; and (4) the
    parsing and compilation are factored into two parts, that done
    on individual lines and that done globally to handle the
    relationships between the lines. december, 1972 earley, j.

    <text>proposal for a feasible programming system this paper
    proposes designing a programming facility (itself involving a
    digital computer and a program) which will assist the
    preparation of large-scale real-time programs. this facility is
    to be capable of preparing programs for any of a variety of
    machines having characteristics similar to those of the
    facility's computer. one of the basic assumptions is that there
    will be enough random-access storage available to avoid the
    necessity for segmenting a constructed program in any fashion
    other than a trivial one. while this assumption is somewhat
    unrealistic, it is intended to provide an opportunity to
    concentrate on the other aspects of program construction. the
    programming system should stress the discovery in source
    program statements of as many errors as possible, before
    attempting to construct an object program. among the computer
    characteristics which are advocated are a program interrupt
    scheme, a large set of characters, and indirect addressing.

    <text>dynamic verification of operating system decisions
    dynamic verification of a decision implies that every time the
    decision is made there is a consistency check performed on the
    decision using independent hardware and software. the dynamic
    verification of operating system decisions is used on the prime
    system being designed and constructed at the university of
    california, berkeley. prime is an experimental time-sharing
    which is to have the properties of continuous availability,
    data privacy, and cost effectiveness. the technique of dynamic
    verification allows the construction of an operating system
    which does not make certain decisions improperly even in the
    presence of a single hardware or software fault. furthermore,
    multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only if the faults
    happen to reinforce each other. on prime, dynamic verification
    is used to ensure that one user's information cannot become
    available to another user gratuitously even in the presence of
    a single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
    hardware and software required for dynamic verification can be
    modest. november, 1973 fabry, r. s. operating systems, data

    <text>long range budget planning in large public libraries.
    argues that if a large public library makes a practice of
    gathering information on which to build budget requests, the
    time consuming data gathering can be reduced in subsequent
    years by examining the overall requested growth rate for the
    system and adjusting the figures where needed to bring it in
    line with what is feasible. the adjusted figures can then be
    returned to the requesting librarians for them to see what can
    be expected as a request. demonstrates how, in times when funds
    are scarce, this practice will act as an informational and
    decision-making tool and will serve to adjust library needs to
    zero-base budgeting practices.</text>

    <text>cataloguing in the university library' development and

    alphabetical cataloguing, regensburg university library uses
    the rak rules for academic libraries; further streamlining will
    be carried out here because the bavarian state library will
    shortly join the bavarian new university libraries' interloan
    system. keyword use is standardised; a keyword index published
    every 6 months assists in unifying practice. english keywords
    are used for biology and pre-clinical medicine, german for
    other subjects. regensburg university's own classification
    scheme is used here and in other libraries in the interloan
    scheme. since 1974 printed catalogue volumes have been replaced
    by com-process microfiche, which may in turn be replaced by
    on-line methods when these have become cheaper. access to other
    regional library networks may soon be available through

    <text>the professional preparation of librarians at university
    level. the professional training of librarians has not improved
    in italy during the last 50 years. university reform has
    completely ignored the problem of library organisation in
    respect of research and teaching. librarians should take degree
    courses in the specific disciplines of the cultural areas
    served by the libraries in which they intend to work.
    professional preparation cannot be considered complete without
    adequate practical experience. librarians lacking the capacity
    to organise a library on traditional lines will not profit much
    from the assistance of advanced technology. the university
    should rationalise its own libraries and concentrate its
    internal services at all levels on satisfying the requests of
    all potential readers.</text>

    batched, so that card handling and lost processing time is at a
    minimum. this system will perform any or all of the following
    users specified functions: assemble sps source decks, post
    list, produce condensed or uncondensed object decks, execute
    user's program, list card input to a program, list punched
    output, provide a storage dump, execute a program submitted for

    events with a relative error which is substantially independent
    of the number n of events. this relative error can be expected
    to be 24 percent or less 95 percent of the time (i.e.o = n/8).

    dramatic increase in the number of independent nation states.
    the degree of accessibility to treaty information is much

    preserve of government officials, thanks to publications like
    the united nations treaty series. there is still a need,

    <text>protection of the individual, libraries and computers.
    the introduction of computerised identification has alarmed
    many people in denmark as elsewhere. under an 1978 act the
    national library office has already encountered problems on
    cataloguing and authors' royalties. the main question concerns
    the linking of borrower to book, though this was equally
    possible with older issue systems. in 2 recent cases involving
    terrorism and murder, libraries have reluctantly supplied
    police with information generally regarded as confidential. the
    library office proposes an explicit statement of librarians'
    duty to maintain confidentiality, abd stricter control of
    out-of-date photographic issue records. when computer issue
    systems become common, such information will be more easily
    obtained, and the danish library commission considers that it
    should be made impossible to trace a borrower once his book is
    returned. while this should be covered by the 1978 act, any
    future revision of the library act should state the position in
    unambiguous terms.</text>

    <text>when the library school wants to alter its road-map.
    reactions of librarians to recent proposals (taking account of
    the 1976-77 reports on possible elevation to university status)
    for a new curriculum in the norwegian state library school.
    points covered include the proposed 2-year common course, with
    specialisation in the 3rd year (generally approved); methods
    subjects (bibliography is considered necessary, but some
    consider computer studies nowadays equally essential);
    literature and society (thought to merit more attention,
    especially children's literature, popular literature, and
    services to handicapped and immigrants); information science
    (should be included in 2 or even 3 years); administration
    (considered absolutely essential); practical training (should
    probably be extended); evaluation of students' work (general
    opinion favours the retention of marking together with
    continuous evaluation); lecturing staff (library experience is
    preferred to academic specialisation); intake of stud ents (as
    far as possible should cover the whole country). better liaison
    on education between school and library profession is felt
    desirable, but there seems no major disagreement between the
    curriculum committee and librarians in the field.</text>

    <text>plate tectonics: a study of transmission of ideas.
    applying bibliometric techniques to the data analysed from
    science citation index for the years 1968-77, it was found that
    the le pichon's well known article published in 1968 in the
    2journal of geophysical research1 proved 'infectious'. the
    article received 593 citations during this period and followed
    a well defined epidemic pattern, receiving maximum citations in
    the year 1970 and getting slowly stabilised in the year
    1974.</text>

    <text>dynamic response time prediction for computer networks if
    the ultimate aim of a computing network is resource sharing,
    then the human component as well as the technical component of
    networking must be fully investigated to achieve this goal.
    this research is a first step toward assisting the user in
    participating in the vast store of resources available on a
    network. analytical, simulation, and statistical performance
    evaluation tools are employed to investigate the feasibility of
    a dynamic response time monitor that is capable of providing
    comparative response time information for users wishing to
    process various computing applications at some network
    computing node. the research clearly reveals that sufficient
    system data are currently obtainable, at least for the five
    diverse arpa network systems studied in detail, to describe and
    predict the response time for network time-sharing systems as
    it depends on some measure of system activity or load level.
