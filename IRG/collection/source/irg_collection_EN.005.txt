he structure of a general contour map is analyzed, and its
    topological properties are utilized in developing a new
    scanning algorithm. the problem of detection and recognition of
    contour lines is solved by a two color labeling method. it is
    shown that for maps containing normal contour lines only, it
    suffices to distinguish between so-called "even" and "odd"
    lines. the "tangency problem" involved in practical scanning is
    discussed, and a solution based on minimizing computer memory
    space and simplifying control program is suggested. september,

    <text>a fast method for solving a class of tridiagonal linear
    systems the solution of linear systems having real, symmetric,
    diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient matrices with
    constant diagonals is considered. it is proved that the
    diagonals of the lu decomposition converges when floating-point
    precision. it is also proved that the computed lu decomposition
    converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the
    limits of the lu diagonals using floating point are roughly
    within machine precision of the limits using real arithmetic.
    this fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point
    operations required to solve a linear system from 8n-7 to
    5n+2k-3, where k is much less than n, the order of the matrix.
    if the elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are 1,
    then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed. the entire lu
    decomposition takes k words of storage, and considerable
    savings in array subscripting are achieved. upper and lower
    bounds on k are obtained in terms of the ratio of the
    coefficient matrix diagonal constants and parameters of the
    floating-point number system. various generalizations of these
    results are discussed. january, 1974 malcolm, m. a. palmer, j.

    the applied voltage there are three possible values for for the
    flux in the inductor of which the middle value is unstable the
    differential equation representing the circuit has been solved
    using an analogue computer for the case when the system is
    released in the region of the lower stable state the solution
    corresponds to two sinusoidal oscillations of different
    amplitude and frequency if the system is released in the region
    of the upper stable state the solution corresponds to an

    <text>some comments on the curriculum of the basic branch of
    study-library science, intramural study. the intramural course
    of study at the humboldt university in berlin leading to a
    degree in library science provides future librarians with
    scientifically based knowledge and good practical career
    training. a student follows courses in subjects related to
    library science, marxism and leninism, and foreign languages,
    russian, english and french. several practical work periods
    spent in different public and research libraries make up part
    of the course. librarian students also attend courses in
    subjects such as information science, technology and modern
    media to enable them to follow future developments in these
    fields affecting the library system. the course of study lasts
    8 terms, the last of which is spent in a library doing
    practical work and researching for a thesis for the final
    examination. the title awarded to librarians on passing the
    finals is diplombibliothekar (diploma librarian). the co urse
    also tries to stimulate students to independent study while at
    university and to expand their knowledge continuously in their
    future careers.</text>

    <text>children's access to library systems. paper presented at
    the 41st conference of the graduate library school, university
    of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
    materials in school and public libraries. in order to guarantee
    children access to information, we must' establish the
    appropriate resource-sharing arrangements; grant children the
    right to participate in them; and include children's materials
    and resources in the developing data systems. current studies
    reveal that, although as children reach junior high age they
    use the public library predominantly for school projects,
    neither school nor public libraries are important in the
    child's total pattern of information seeking. lack of
    transportation, time, and school assignments based on library
    resources contribute to this pattern. while multiple
    cooperatives such as those developing in colorado and being
    initiated in new york are of interest and show promise,
    large-scale failure to develop inter- and intralibrary loan
    policies and procedures which include children and young adults
    as users further inhibit access by the young. as of this time,
    little of the massive amount of curricular, historical,
    textual, or literary materials for children are being included
    in developing automated data bases and systems, thus denying
    their access to adults as well as to youth. in fighting the
    battle of access for the young, librarians must develop broader
    competencies in the areas of management and communications
    technology.</text>

    <text>selling to survive. edited and abridged version of a talk
    given at the library association's branch and mobile libraries

    income-generating innovations will help the public library in
    the short term, the resultant revenue will always be a
    relatively small proportion of the budget and such activities
    could prejudice the library's long term survival by giving the
    public the wrong impression. only a more business-like,
    planned, balanced approach than previously practised can save
    the public library. marketing can offer such an approach. the
    library should tailor services to meet the needs of its
    community, train its staff to be salespeople, and work on

    <text>numerical integration of function that has a pole it is
    common to need to integrate numerically functions that diverge
    somewhere outside the range of integration. even if the
    divergence occurs quite far away, integration formulas like
    simpson's, that depend on fitting a polynomial, usually will be
    inaccurate: near a pole they will be very bad. a method is
    described that gives formulas that will integrate functions of
    this kind accurately if the orders and positions of the poles
    are known. explicit formulas are given that are easy to use on
    an automatic computer. it is shown that they can be used for
    some other singularities as well as poles. if the integral
    converges, integration can be carried to the singularity. the
    accuracy of the integration with a pole of second order is
    discussed, and, as an example, the new formula is compared with
    simpson's. the new formulas are useful even far from the pole,
    while near the pole their advantage is overwhelming. april,

    <text>our tasks. the official 1977-unesco statistics show that,
    as far as numbers of libraries and librarians, and also annual
    acquisitions per head of population, are concerned, bulgaria
    lies in the 7th and 4th places respectively in the world.
    however, bulgaria takes the 14th and 19th places in loans and
    in turnover of current book collections. thus, higher
    efficiency required in all fields of the nation's life by the
    recent 12th congress of the bulgarian communist party must also
    be aimed for in libraries and information centres. great
    attention must be paid in particular to scientific and other
    special libraries which need to cope not only with the present
    information explosion, but also with soaring prices of western
    publications and bulgaria's limited foreign currency resources.
    amongst other problems are the education and training of
    librarians, the needs in new library buildings, mechanisation,
    automation, and updating of library management. the cyril and
    methodius national library, not only as keeper of the national
    literary heritage, but also as the most important library and
    information centre in the whole country, is, in itself, a
    special case. it should be relieved of some of its problems on

    children and young adults, and most children attend the 3 local
    community schools. there is no library service at present in
    the buin area, but the buin provincial high school library
    serves both as a school and public library. a proper public
    library should be built in the town centre, run independently
    of the school library, and community information centres or
    mobile services should operate in each area, the former staffed
    by a librarian and a teacher. school dropouts (the area has
    many) could communicate effectively with the people about the
    importance of library use, with a view to possible library
    training for those who work successfully.</text>

    <text>the electronic office and the quality of working life. it
    is commonly claimed that the application of new technology to
    the office reduces routine labour and frees the employee for
    more creative work. disputes this claim by examining in detail
    the effects of automated systems on the job content and job
    satisfaction of 2 types of clerical jobs' production control
    and tele-sales. the source of the decline in the quality of
    working life in these 2 areas is located not in the technology
    itself but management aims and methods in its implementation.
    suggests possible alternative methods of work

    <text>levels of computer systems in building current computer
    systems, we tend to break them down into "levels" of control,
    command and communication; in using the system, we break our
    problems down correspondingly. the continued use of such a
    structure raises questions about its effects on the usefulness
    of future systems, particularly with regard to such trends as
    time sharing, parallel programming, and, eventually, systems
    which learn. in this essay some of these questions are posed,
    and the general attitude we must take in pursuing the problem
    further is discussed. december, 1966 bryant, p. ca661208 jb

    <text>using the text telephone-something for libraries?.
    describes the text telephone installed in landskrona public
    library early in 1981 for the use of the deaf and speech
    impaired. it consists of 3 units' an ordinary telephone, a
    keyboard used to type the text, and a screen monitor, which
    receives and transmits the text. the handicapped person needs
    also a signal relay, which transforms the audible telephone
    signals to visual signals, and he must be able to type as the
    keyboard is that of a standard typewriter. disabled people can
    contact others with similar equipment, but contact to an
    ordinary telephone requires a transformer. the telephone
    directory has special markings for text telephones. expansion
    of the service, which provides an opportunity to reach new and

    <text>oslo and its most important libraries. oslo, with 456,000
    inhabitants, enjoys a public library service from 2 main
    centres-the university library (ubo) and the deichmanske
    biblioteket. the ubo serves both as a university and national
    library, thereby creating a series of difficulties in the
    structural organisation of the service. bibliographic work has
    been facilitated by the use of computers, and national and
    international bibliographies are in process. the public has a
    single alphabetical author and subject catalogue, and
    bureaucratic formalities have been reduced to a minimum. the
    deichmanske is distinguished from other scandinavian libraries
    by its widespread service to schools and educational
    institutes. it aims to procure and lend books unobtainable from
    other sources. both libraries leave the impression of an
    efficient service which has eliminated all sources of
    discouragement to users.</text>

    <text>a comparison of multivariate normal generators three

    requires the least computer execution time and memory space
    when utilizing the ibm 360/67. all methods use as a basis a
    standard gaussian random number generator. results of the
    comparison indicate that the method based on triangular
    factorization of the covariance matrix generally requires less
    memory space and computer time than the other two methods.

    technology opens new possibilities in dissemination of
    information, and public libraries must take part. the principle
    of free access to information, knowledge and culture must be
    upheld. state, local government and private information
    data-bases must be accessible to the public. library resources
    must be considered as a whole, and all public libraries
    governed by one directorate. the national bibliography must be
    the starting-point for any system of public library data-bases.
    the anonymity of the borrower should be safeguarded. trade
    unions say that any loss of jobs through computerisation must
    be balanced by new jobs in other areas, preferably releasing
    staff for improved reader service. existing documents on the
    influence of automation must be implemented. there must be a
    specific statement regarding employer/employee relations in
    public libraries, and working conditions must not deteriorate.
    computers must not be used to oversee employees' work
    efficiency. staff must receive full instruction on the

    activities. previous work on interrelated record clustering
    techniques is described. methods for the partial reorganisation
    of data files are described and compared with the total sort

    described are sorting in order of the catenated key formed from

    cluster; sorting gave the best results, but is not suitable for

    <text>natural language question-answering systems: 1969 recent
    experiments in programming natural language question-answering
    systems are reviewed to summarize the methods that have been
    developed for syntactic, semantic, and logical analysis of
    english strings. it is concluded that at least minimally
    effective techniques have been devised for answering questions
    from natural language subsets in small scale experimental
    systems and that a useful paradigm has evolved to guide
    research efforts in the field. current approaches to semantic
    analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective
    beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either
    to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large
    subsets of english. generalizing from current small-scale
    experiments to language-processing systems based on
    dictionaries with thousands of entries-with correspondingly
    large grammars and semantic systems-may entail a new order of
    complexity and require the invention and development of
    entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and
    questions answering. january, 1970 simmons, r. f.

    <text>fen-an axiomatic basis for program semantics a formal
    system is presented which abstracts the notions of data item,
    function, and relation. it is argued that the system is more
    suitable than set theory (or its derivatives) for the concise
    and accurate description of program semantics. it is shown how
    the system can be used to build composite data types out of
    simper ones with the operations of rowing, structuring, and
    uniting. it is also demonstrated that completely new primitive
    types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of
    singleton data types. both deterministic and nondeterministic
    functions are shown to be definable in the system. it is
    described how the local environment can be modeled as a data
    item and how imperative statements can be considered functions
    on the environment. the nature of recursive functions is
    briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they
    can be introduced into the system. the technique is contrasted
    with the use of the paradoxical combinator, y. the questions of
    local and global environments and of various modes of function
    calling and parameter passing are touched upon. the theory is
    applied to the proof of several elementary theorems concerning
    the semantics of the assignment, conditional, and iterative
    statements. an appendix is included which presents in detail

    <text>a gloomy outlook for libraries?. public library
    development has halted at a point when, because of the
    recession, library services are particularly necessary. current
    economic measures have hit libraries hard. some people now
    regard information as merchandise for which a suitable market
    price must be obtained; this increases the risk of information
    services being taken over by private companies, which could
    lead to reductions in state budgets. the rapid development of
    information technology threatens to bypass the library service
    and because of the competitive situation on the information
    market libraries are being asked to restrict themselves to
    their traditional tasks. libraries must mobilise reserves
    hitherto unused; refusing to implement new methods of
    literature provision could have disastrous consequences.
    initial organisational problems can be overcome through
    rationalisation, centralisation and wider use of electronic
    data processing.</text>

    <text>journal acquisition and cost-effectiveness in a special
    library' a case study. brookes' model, based on traditional
    bradford's approach, as a quantification method, has some
    loopholes which can be overcome by ranking journals considering
    both productivity and subscription cost. this paper reports
    such a study. the major findings are 1) this method is a
    further improvement and rationalisation of brookes' method and
    traditional bradford's approach. 2) there is a steady decrease
    in the value of rupee in terms of yield of relevant papers and
    thus journal acquisition reaches the point of diminishing
    returns at a certain stage. 3) there is a significant
    difference in the 2 ranked lists.</text>

    the existing framework of regulations applicable to radio,

    be regulated differently. it is uncertain if the copyright law
    in canada covers information stored in computers such as that

    <text>aparel-a parse-request language aparel is described: this
    language is an extension to an algorithmic language (pl/i) that
    provides the pattern-matching capabilities normally found only
    in special purpose languages such as snobol4 and tmg. this
    capability is provided through parse-requests stated in a
    bnf-like format. these parse-requests form their own
    programming language with special sequencing rules. upon
    successfully completing a parse-request, an associated piece of
    pl/i code is executed. this code has available for use, as
    normal pl/i strings the various pieces (at all levels) of the
    parse. it also has available as normal pl/i variables, the
    information concerning which of the various alternatives were
    successful. convenient facilities for multiple input-output
    streams, the initiation of sequences of parse-requests as a
    subroutine, and parse-time semantic checks are also included.
    aparel has proven convenient in building a powerful syntax and
    function macro system, an algebraic language preprocessor
    debugging system, an on-line command parser, a translator for
    dataless programming, and as a general string manipulator.

    which they overlap. it is suggested that there is some
    similarity between the idea of a file directory and a storable
    object of type context. manipulations with contexts are then
    discussed at length. it is noted that there is a simple
    extension of church's lambda notation that deals nicely with
    these ideas of context manipulation. whereas a function can be
    regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of
    the expression lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), it is
    found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction based upon
    the first two terms in the equivalent expression mu(name
    list)(value list)(expression). july, 1971 fraser, a. g. file,

    <text>planning of librarianship and library legislation in
    austria' the university library system. paper presented at the
    1st austrian-soviet seminar on the role of libraries in a
    country's socio-economic and cultural life, held at the lenin
    state library, 20-22 mar 79. the reform of austrian research
    libraries started with the establishment in 1970 of the federal
    ministry of science and research under whose jurisdiction now
    belongs 60% of research libraries. the centralisation has
    proved beneficial for library development planning. in 1975 the
    law on university organisational structure was passed resulting
    in the reorganisation of academic libraries with the aim of
    building a coordinated and integrated library system based on
    unified principles. organisational structure, functions and
    policies of the system are discussed in detail. concludes with
    a review of other laws related to library development.</text>

    <text>an experiment in a user-oriented computer system a
    version of a software-hardware system for the purpose of
    facilitating the programming and analysis of well-formulated
    problems is described. a modified flexowriter is used to
    generate computer-acceptable input when equations or computable
    requests are typed in much the same manner as they would appear
    in conventional mathematical texts. the typing and language
    rules are quite flexible and unrestrictive. while the compiler
    part is efficient, the system as a whole has much broader
    aspects as a tool for the study of problem solving and
    self-teaching systems. may, 1964 klerer, m. may, j. ca640506 jb

    <text>fact retrieval for the 1980s. reviews prevailing
    methodologies of fact retrieval in science and technology and
    makes projections for the decade to come' numeric data bases
    are shown to overtake in size and number the large
    bibliographic collections. this is expected to lead toward more
    sophisticated, interactive data analysis techniques with
    graphical display options. the availability of low-cost
    intelligent computer terminals, micro- and minicomputers, is
    shown to make aggregation and post-processing of retrieved
    information from different sources readily possible. this
    capability may come into conflict with legal constraints and is
    bound to affect the traditional marketing of information. it
    will lead to the extraction of higher forms of intelligence
    from text and data. the user community is seen to shift from
    expert information specialists, who act now as middlemen, to
    the end-users of information. this less experienced user
    community will challenge the ingenuity of system designers for
    self-guiding, adaptive, and yet more sophisticated man-machine
    interfaces. the merging of wide-band digital communication
    networks with computer technologies will make it possible to
    interconnect computers, information centres, word processors,
    and other peripherals, worldwide.</text>

    training. the accelerated development of culture, science and
    technology has resulted in a new type of library user. the user
    now requires not only library material, but also analysed,
    evaluated information. this in turn has given rise to new
    professional branches of librarianship and information science.

    <text>pl/i list processing the concepts of list processing have
    been introduced into the pl/i language. with these new
    facilities, it is possible to write pl/i procedures that
    operate on simple and complex data list organizations. most
    list-processing languages have suffered from their inability to
    deal directly with complex data structures and/or from their
    inability to perform the complete range of programming language
    operations upon the data list structures. these two problems
    have been eliminated in the list-processing facilities of pl/i.
    the basic concepts of list processing and the philosophy of the
    pl/i language extensions are discussed. in addition, several
    detailed list-processing examples are provided. june, 1967

    <text>the smart automatic document retrieval system-an
    illustration a fully automatic document retrieval system
    operating on the ibm 7094 is described. the system is
    characterized by the fact that several hundred different
    methods are available to analyze documents and search requests.
    this feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the
    exact sequence of operations initially unspecified, and
    adapting the search strategy to the needs of individual users.
    the system is used not only to simulate an actual operating
    environment, but also to test the effectiveness of the various
    available processing methods. results obtained so far seem to
    indicate that some combination of analysis procedures can in
    general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information. a
    typical search request is used as an example in the present
    report to illustrate systems operations and evaluation
    procedures. june, 1965 salton, g. lesk, m. e. ca650619 jb march

    <text>a6 size microfiche for the motor industry. introduction
    to british standards bs 5956:1980. the motor industry has, over
    the years, gradually adopted the microfiche for the supply of
    information relating to specification and service parts. a
    british standard has now been produced, recommending the use of
    an a6 microfiche produced to a 48x with a total of 270
    landscape images per fiche as the preferred standard, with an
    alternative of 420 portrait images also at 48x. the standard is
    recommended for introduction by all new users in the motor
    industry of microfiche systems, and also has a strong
    suggestion that those vehicle/engine manufacturers who are
    already using a non-standard microfiche system consider
    changing in the very near future.</text>

    that user responses to a less restricted selection of books be

    this theme, arguing that the library's priority is to provide
    satisfactory documentation and information services; other
    activities are only of secondary importance, and should be

    their most recent paper have presented a very interesting
    programming system that they have developed for the ferranti

    features of their system. it expands on some points that the
    original authors cover briefly, and treats only very lightly
    some topics to which they devote considerable space. the
    purpose of this paper is purely expository. except in some very

    <text>the reallocation of hash-coded tables when the space
    allocation for a hash-coded table is altered, the table entries
    must be rescattered over the new space. a technique for
    accomplishing this rescattering is presented. the technique is
    independent of both the length of the table and the hashing
    function used, and can be utilized in conjunction with a linear
    reallocation of the table being rescattered. moreover, it can
    be used to eliminate previously flagged deletions from any
    hash-coded table, or to change from one hashing method to
    another. the efficiency of the technique is discussed and
    theoretical statistics are given. january, 1973 bays, c.

    <text>a grammar base question answering procedure the subject
    of this paper is a procedure for the automatic retrieval of
    certain segments of stored information, either explicitly or
    implicitly represented, through questions posed in natural
    language sentences. this procedure makes use of a sentence
    recognition device for the class of grammars which will
    correctly decide between the grammatical and ungrammatical
    sentences of a natural language. it is possible to make use of
    a recognition device of this sort for the following reason:
    much data is fully expressible as a set of sentences in a
    natural language, a set which can be exhaustively and
    exclusively generated by a grammar. based upon the rules of
    this grammar, a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences,
    questions in the normal situation. since the recognition
    function succeeds just in case the posed question is drawn from
    the set of sentences expressing the data, or, more correctly,
    is grammatical in terms of the grammar for this set of
    sentences, sentence recognition itself is a procedure for
    retrieving information. when the recognition function succeeds,
    its value represents the requested information. october, 1967

    <text>two languages for estimating program efficiency two
    languages enabling their users to estimate the efficiency of
    computer programs are presented. the program whose efficiency
    one wishes to estimate is written in the first language, a
    go-to-less programming language which includes most of the
    features of algol 60. the second language consists of
    interactive commands enabling its users to provide additional
    information about the program written in the first language and
    to output results estimating its efficiency. processors for the
    two languages are also described. the first processor is a
    syntax-directed translator which compiles a program into a
    symbolic formula representing the execution time for that
    program. the sound processor is a set of procedures for that
    program. the second processor is a set of procedures for
    algebraic manipulation which can be called by the user to
    operate on the formula produced by the first processor.
    examples of the usage of the two languages are included. the
    limitations of the present system, its relation to knuth's work
    on the analysis of algorithms, and some of the directions for
    further research are also discussed. june, 1974 ccohen, j.

    <text>information processing networks in international banking.
    during the past decade there has been increasing concern over
    the social, economic and political impacts of international
    computerised information networks. this study suggests that
    there are at least 3 levels of such networks, each with the
    potential for increasingly greater social or organisational
    impact. based on that categorisation, international banking was
    chosen as the focus for an attitude survey concerning the
    perceived effects among bankers of using international
    networks. results indicate that telex is much more important
    for daily international banking operations than computer
    networks, although within 6 years computer networks are
    expected to replace telex in importance.</text>

    increasing, as evidenced by reports in the literature. however,
    much work has yet to be done which uses sophisticated
    evaluation techniques. reports the follow-up of an earlier
    study by examining the long-term retention of library-use
    skills. through use of pretesting and posttesting, control and
    experimental groups, aggregate and individual comparisons,
    multiple regression, and other techniques, concludes that
    long-term possession of library-use skills is more highly
    related to library-use instruction than to either inherent
    intellectual ability or academic diligence. in addition,
    discusses the appropriateness of quantitative and qualitative
    methods of evaluation and caution against taking for granted

    density between the earth and the moon are discussed these are
    based on the determination of the group retardation suffered by
    low frequency radar echoes very high peak power pulse technique
    or very high equipment stability cw technique would be required
    to measure absolute radar range but this difficulty can be
    avoided by sending a reference signal with the measuring signal

    <text>library use as a leisure activity. introductory speech to
    the study session of the working party for county library
    systems, noordwijkerhout, 1 sept 81. in the netherlands, the
    rise in living standards since world war ii has outstripped the
    increase in leisure time. in addition the average citizen
    devotes a large proportion of his increased purchasing power to
    acquiring private comforts. whereas before the war most people
    visited the cinema or theatre for entertainment, and travelled
    by bus or train, nowadays they watch television at home and
    travel by private car. similarly research shows that the
    average citizen uses the library not as a substitute for a
    private collection of books but to supplement his own
    collection. as the economic recession deepens there is a real
    danger that the government will turn public libraries into
    recreational centres and create new libraries as information
    centres.</text>

    <text>automated text processing as an aid to rationalising
    purchasing and stock administration in documentation. formerly
    most information had to be obtained from original documents,
    resulting in the recovery of only a few coincidental
    references. the use of on-line techniques facilitates the
    making of global information surveys independent of sources at
    hand. automated text processing reduces the need for direct
    contact with published material and maintenance of original
    stocks. the sulzer company uses automated text processing in
    ordering and supply of information, for the catalogue,
    accessions index, periodical subscription control and printing
    the periodical index; the computer system is described in
    detail. control of periodical circulation is also being
    incorporated into the system. thus work procedures have been
    reduced, leaving staff free for more demanding tasks.</text>

    <text>generation of optimal code for expressions via

    of the object code produced by first factoring the expressions,
    i.e. finding a set of subexpressions each of which occurs in
    two or more other expressions or subexpressions. once all the
    factors have been ascertained, a sequencing procedure is
    applied which orders the factors and expressions such that all
    information is computed in the correct sequence and factors
    need be retained in memory a minimal amount of time. an
    assignment algorithm is then executed in order to minimize the
    total number of temporary storage cells required to hold the
    results of evaluating the factors. in order to make these
    techniques computationally feasible, heuristic procedures are
    applied, and hence global optimal results are not necessarily
    generated. the factorization algorithms are also applicable to
    the problem of factoring boolean switching expressions and of
    factoring polynomials encountered in symbol manipulating
    systems. june, 1969 breuer, m. a. factorization algorithms,

    <text>a correspondence between algol 60 and church's

    semantics of algol 60 can be formalized by establishing a
    correspondence between expressions of algol 60 and expressions
    in a modified form of church's l-notation. first a model for
    computer languages and compute behavior is described, based on
    the notions of functional application and functional
    abstraction, but also having analogues for imperative language
    features. then this model is used as an "abstract object
    language" into which algol 60 is mapped. many of algol 60's
    features emerge as particular arrangements of a small number of
    structural rules, suggesting new classifications and
    generalizations. the correspondence is first described
    informally, mainly by illustrations. the second part of the
    paper gives a formal description, i.e. an "abstract compiler"
    into the "abstract objct language." this is itself presented in
    a "purely functional" notation, that is one using only
    application and abstraction. february, 1965 landin, p. j.

    briefly surveys the work of the associations in the last year.
    suggests that we should look carefully at how we use our time'
    the pareto principle states that the most trivial 20% of
    accomplishment usually consumes 80% of your time whilst the

    <text>the factfinder information retrieval system. factfinder
    is a minicomputer-based information handling package developed
    on the basis of total information management. within the system
    the concepts of text processing and word processing are united
    to provide effective management of information at every stage.
    thus, factfinder combines flexible data input facilities with a
    powerful retrieval capability, enhanced by the inclusion of
    efficient editing and reporting functions. factfinder is
    specifically designed for interactive use in a multi-user
    environment. input is user-defined and may be free text or
    formatted. editing and retrieval are also on-line procedures
    and due to factfinder's efficient background processing
    facility, the updating and printing functions may run
    simultaneously with these on-line terminal activities. any
    batch routines are also initiated at the terminals although
    these are few and of a utility or security nature. factfinder
    is based on the swedish imdoc system and is m arketed by mcs
    mini-computer systems ltd. the software is written in extensive
    basic and the system is available as a complete package of
    software and hardware based on the data general range of
    minicomputers. both software and hardware are fully supported

    <text>digital simulation of discrete flow systems* the discrete
    flow systems discussed are characterized by the movement of
    randomly arriving items along interacting channels. programing
    a digital computer to simulate such systems utilizes some
    techniques not common in other approaches to physical problems.
    the principal portion of the paper is a discussion of two
    simulation studies that illustrate some of the programming
    problems involved. one is of an extensive package-handling
    plant, with the objective being optimization of parameters such
    as storage capacities and processing rates. in the other, air
    traffic flow and control procedures are simulated to compare
    the effects of alternative control decisions. december, 1960

    was striking. brixton serves a population of about 90,000, 25%
    of whom are users. the library emphasises outreach services and
    teamwork among the 20 staff employed by the main and 2 branch
    libraries. thus the library serves institutions such as old
    people's homes, hostels for the homeless, youth clubs, prisons.
    help is given to advice centres and 100 people are visited in
    their homes. the children's section contained few books and was
    little used. the riots had not affected the library and good
    relations existed with the young people and their leaders. the

    <text>copying list structures using bounded workspace two new
    algorithms are presented for list structure copying using
    bounded workspace. the first, of primarily theoretical
    interest, shows that without cell tag bits the task can be
    performed in time n^2. the second algorithm, assuming one tag
    bit in each cell, delivers attractive practical speed. any
    noncyclic structure is copied in linear speed, while cyclic
    structures are copied in average time less than nlogn. no
    foreknowledge of cycle absence is necessary to achieve linear
    speed. a variation of the second algorithm solves an open
    problem concerning list structure marking. that result
    demonstrates that marking can be done in average time nlogn
    without the aid of supplemental tag bits or stacks. april, 1974

    <text>the aims of mobile library services. during the last 13
    years of the 20 years' existence of mobile library service in
    finland this service has become of considerable importance.
    there is a mobile library standard and the finnish library
    association has set up a mobile library working group. training
    of drivers has been neglected although they deal with the bulk
    of the loans. the mobiles, until the introduction of the
    standard, were uncomfortable and wasteful in energy, and had a
    short life. this year 4.5 million f marks will be spent on new
    mobiles by about 12 local authorities. 40 authorities have
    applied for a grant. the following aspects of a mobile service
    need developing: improved services and their rationalisation,
    training of drivers, cooperative purchase of mobiles by 2 or
    more authorities.</text>

    examines the differences in subject approaches found between 2

    current index to journals in education (cije). a sample of 30
    journal articles was taken from each tool in the areas of
    educational psychology, school administration, and special
    education; after an investigation of the characteristics of the
    displays of thesaural descriptors in cije and the subject
    headings in education index, an analysis was made of the topics
    under which each article was indexed in both tools. the data
    analysis includes a quantitative description of the sample, the

    place against the post-war bureaucratic society. with the
    sudden change in the economic climate and the rise in
    unemployment in the 1970s professionals employed in the social

    volunteers as a threat to their own positions. however,
    although voluntary workers in libraries may lack professional
    expertise they are often more socially-motivated than their

    <text>the underlying characteristics of the bradford
    distribution. the bradford distribution differs from most
    probability distributions in that it is concerned with the
    rank-order s of the elements in terms of their productivity
    (from highest down to lowest) rather than with the numerical
    values n of the element's productivity. the defining
    relationship is that s is exponentially related to g, the
    cumulative production of the elements of rank-order s or less.
    this implies a zipf-like relationship between mean productivity
    and rank-order, which is analogous to the weber-fechner law of
    psychophysics. a variational specification of the distribution
    is given, and it is pointed out that the relationship between
    the construction of the bradford and that of the usual
    distributions is roughly analogous to the relationship between
    lebesgue and riemann integration.</text>

    constructs the constructs of a simple programming language are
    introduced and described informally in terms of values and

    language into flowcharts for a simple machine. the action of
    the machine in executing a flowchart is defined. a proof is
    constructed that the effect of translating and executing any
    program can be expressed solely in terms of the value and
    side-effect of the program. during the course of constructing
    the proof, formal definitions of the concepts of value and
    side-effect are derived in order to make the proof rigorous.
    correctness of the implementation involves checking that the

    only because of the emergence after world war i of an

    <text>a parser-generating system for constructing compressed
    compilers this paper describes a parser-generating system (pgs)
    currently in use on the cdc-6500 computer at purdue university.
    the pgs is a fortran-coded compiler. in the input translation
    grammar, each bnf syntactic rule corresponds to a (possibly
    empty) "code generator" realizable as an assembly language,
    fortran or algol, subroutine that is called whenever that
    syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a program. typical
    one-pass compilers constructed by the pgs translate source
    programs at speeds approaching 14,000 cards per minute. for an
    xpl compiler, the parser program and its tables currently
    occupy 288 words of 60-bit core memory of which 140 words are
    parsing table entries and 82 words are links to code
    generators. november, 1973 mickunas, m. d. schneider, v. b.

    organisational format has been caused by the specific features
    of the patent information system for national economy
    specialists; these features stem from the planned nature of the
    socialist economy and its influence throughout industry.
    stresses the key role of the ussr state committee for
    inventions and discoveries, which supervises the patent
    specialist training and in-service training establishments;
    outlines a typical curriculum; and points out the necessity of
    teaching fundamental principles of patent science to those
    involved in the development of new technology and
    equipment.</text>

    <text>optimal storage allocation for serial files a computer
    system uses several serial files. the files reside on a
    direct-access storage device in which storage space is limited.
    records are added to the files either by jobs in batch
    processing mode, or by on-line transactions. each transaction
    (or job) generates a demand vector which designates the space
    required in each file for record addition. whenever one file
    runs out of space, the system must be reorganized. this paper
    considers several criteria for best allocating storage space to
    the files. february, 1979 mendelson, h. pliskin, j.s. yechiali,

    <text>computing standard deviations: accuracy four algorithms
    for the numerical computation of the standard deviation of
    (unweighted) sampled data are analyzed. two of the algorithms
    are well-known in the statistical and computational literature;
    the other two are new algorithms specifically intended for
    automatic computation. our discussion is expository, with
    emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of "accuracy." each
    of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions under
    which it will be accurate. we conclude that all four algorithms
    will provide accurate answers for many problems, but two of the
    algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurate
    on difficult problems than are the other two. september, 1979

    <text>the intrinsically exponential complexity of the
    circularity problem for attribute grammars attribute grammars
    are an extension of context-free grammars devised by knuth as a
    mechanism for including the semantics of a context-free
    language with the syntax of the language. the circularity
    problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics for
    all possible sentences (programs) in fact will be well defined.
    it is proved that this problem is, in general, computationally
    intractable. specifically, it is shown that any deterministic
    algorithm which solves the problem must for infinitely many
    cases use an exponential amount of time.an improved version of
    knuth's circularity testing algorithm is also given, which
    actually solves the problem within exponential time. december,

    and public libraries, which had been administered as a single
    unit with one board, library coordinator, and budget, since
    1974. a study conducted to evaluate the coordinated library
    which existed from 1974-79 examined the operation of the
    library both from the administrative point of view and on a
    day-to-day basis, problems which arose and their solutions,
    community attitudes toward the library, and the advantages and
    disadvantages of such library services. report not available

    of the 80s. other subjects covered by civil servants in local

    servant in the 80s; cooperation and communication between civil
    servants and politicians, and civil servants' right of free
    expression. a survey of library development in denmark since

    the fact that the research libraries did not wish to enter into
    a joint directorate, but argued that some way of securing fair
    resource distribution should be found. the final subject of
    discussion was' provision and management in the libraries of

    <text>serial cost efficiency-a model and case study (in

    without adequate budget increments force many libraries to
    freeze new subscriptions and in many cases to cancel
    subscriptions. the process of deselection raises the question
    of which titles will be retained and which will be
    discontinued. suggests that the evaluation of the relative
    importance of the various titles will be done by using a cost
    efficiency formula. the formula combines 2 factors, the price
    of subscription and the measured use of the journal, and ranks
    periodicals in a given collection in a descending order' at the
    top will be the most cost-efficient title and at the bottom the
    least cost-efficient title. this formula was tried in
    conjunction with a use study of the judaica reading room's ohio

    <text>the physically handicapped and the public library.
    discusses attempts to make public libraries more accessible to
    handicapped people in the usa. changes in the laws have
    encouraged the making of all public buildings accessible to the
    handicapped. this has led to new standards for building and the
    renovation of old buildings some of which have required
    considerable work. the new laws have caused controversy in
    small towns with few, if any, handicapped people over who
    should pay for renovation work. concludes that clearer
    guidelines should be established to make the law more flexible
    and to guarantee that small town buildings such as libraries
    are in compliance with specific alternative services. the
    federal government should also consider providing funding for
    accessibility renovations.</text>

    <text>watfor-the university of waterloo fortran iv compiler
    watfor is an in-core, load-and-go compiler which has been
    implemented within the ibm 7040/44 operating system. fortran iv
    was selected as the source language in order to achieve maximum
    language compatibility with other available compiling systems,
    in particular the ibm 7040/44 fortran iv system. the principal
    advantage of the watfor compiler is that it translates fortran
    iv programs at speeds of up to 100 statements per second. since
    the compiler resides core there is virtually no system
    overhead, and hence large batches of "student" programs may be
    processed very efficiently. the compiler also provides
    extensive error diagnostics, during both the compilation and
    the execution phases of a program run. this feature makes the
    system attractive to both learners and learned users alike.

    <text>a relevant library service. libraries collect, store and
    disseminate relevant knowledge and information to national
    populations. the term 'relevant information' is discussed in
    relation to the kenyan population. approximately 95% of the
    kenyan population is made up of workers and peasants and a
    relevant library service should be aware of the problems that
    these people have to face. the content of the information
    communicated, the way in which it is communicated and the
    language in which it is communicated are important aspects
    which need to be considered by the library service if it is to
    supply information to those people who need it most. the
    people's republic of china is cited as a country where some
    success has been made in overcoming these problems. much
    valuable information has accumulated over the years among the
    population and could be usefully applied if it was successfully
    provided to those who need it.</text>

    <text>nalnet book system' cost benefit study. the goals of the

    current book system, the products and services of a book system
    required by nasa centre libraries, and the characteristics of a
    system that would best supply those products and services were
    assessed. emphasis was placed on determining the most cost
    effective means of meeting nasa's requirements for an automated
    book system. various operating modes were examined including
    the current stims file, the pubfile, developing software
    improvements for products as appropriate to the centre needs,
    and obtaining cataloguing and products from the bibliographic
    utilities including at least oclc, rlin, bna, and stif. it is
    recommended that nalnet operate under the stims file mode and
    obtain cataloguing and products from the bibliographic
    utilities.</text>

    <text>a stopping criterion for polynomial root finding when
    searching for the root of a polynomial, it is generally
    difficult to know just when to accept a number as an adequate
    approximation to the root. in this paper an algorithm is
    presented which allows one to terminate the iteration process
    on the basis of calculated bounds for the roundoff error which
    occurs in evaluating the polynomial. this stopping criterion
    has been tested on numerous examples and has been found to
    serve as a satisfactory means for accepting a complex number as
    a zero of a real polynomial. october, 1967 adams, d. a.

    <text>local authority library planning cannot be abandoned.
    local authorities are legally bound to provide library
    services. the widest possible area should be covered by a
    library network, involving cooperation not only with other
    local authorities but also with other library administrators,
    e.g. the churches and industry. libraries are also important as
    community meeting-places and as educational and cultural
    centres. in many areas minimum standards of library provision
    have not yet been attained. some people call for state
    legislation to improve the library service but this would cause
    too many complications. cultural administration should be
    distinguished by its autonomy and freedom from compulsion by

    novel programming techniques on the other. there has also been

    and form and optimize heuristic rules, and how machines can
    reach similar results. although the vehicle of these
    investigations has been the game of poker, a conceptual
    framework has been provided that should have a fairly wide

    and decision making are incorporated in a large scale complex
    program. they represent both descriptive and normative theories
    of behavior. an in teractive game environment has been recently

    <text>optimizing decision trees through heuristically guided
    search optimal decision table conversion has been tackled in
    the literature using two approaches, dynamic programming and
    branch-and-bound. the former technique is quite effective, but
    its time and space requirements are independent of how "easy"
    the given table is. furthermore, it cannot be used to produce
    good, quasi optimal solutions. the branch-and-bound technique
    uses a good heuristic to direct the search, but is cluttered up
    by an enormous search space, since the number of solutions
    increases with the number of test variables according to a
    double exponential. in this paper we suggest a heuristically
    guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic
    programming, recognizes identical subproblems but which can be
    used to find both optimal and quasi optimal solutions. the
    heuristic search method introduced in this paper combines the
    positive aspects of the above two techniques. compressed tables
    with a large number of variables can be handled without
    deriving expanded tables first. december, 1978 martelli, a.

    efficiency was felt to be the key to putting into order the

    <text>how can library effectiveness be measured?. examines the
    library literature which deals with measurement of library
    effectiveness. this is usually measured in terms of loan
    figures, but this method fails to take account of reference and
    information work, now of growing importance. effectiveness must
    be seen in relation to the library's aims. a manual for
    performance measures in public libraries was published in 1976
    by the american library association. for those libraries which
    actively promote materials to create demands, hamburg et al
    (1972) suggest the following tests for effectiveness' exposure
    counts, item use-days, exposure time. gore (1978) uses the
    holdings rate, availability rate, and performance rate, the
    latter measuring the percentage of required material available
    when wanted by user. it has been pointed out that because
    effectiveness is a composite concept its measurement is
    complex, but that relying on loan figures only is no longer
    necessary.</text>

    <text>computer education in a graduate school of management

    systems requires a thorough understanding of the related
    computer technology. concepts such as paging and priority
    interrupt systems can best be explained at the machine language
    level. any machine used for exposition should fulfill several
    criteria. it should: (1) raise as few spurious issues as
    possible; (2) allow, without undue effort, the solution of
    interesting problems; (3) be capable of exposing all
    outstanding issues of significance, capable of exposing all
    outstanding issues of significance, within the chosen machine;
    (4) be seful for pursuing issues in great depth when
    appropriate; (5) not be committed to the equipment provided by
    any manufacturer; (6) be able to provide the student with
    diagnostic aids to a great depth; (7) allow the student ready
    access to the machine; (8) be capable of extension to expose
    new issues as they come along. we have constructed a simulated
    machine and its associated software which meets these criteria.
    this system, called the prism system, is documented by a primer

    <text>the structure of yet another algol compiler a high-speed
    "top down" method of syntax analysis which completely
    eliminates "back-up" of the source string has been implemented
    in a convenient macro-language. a technique of simulation at
    compile time of the use of a conventional run-time stack
    enables the generation of code for expressions which minimizes
    stores, fetches and stack-pointer motion at run time, while
    properly trating recursion and side effects of procedures.
    block structure and recursion are handled without need for
    interpretive methods at run times. the "context problem" in the
    transmission to recursive procedures of parameters "called by
    name" is solved in a manner which permits the handling of the
    common cases of simple expressions and array identifiers with
    particular efficiency. july, 1965 kanner, h. kosinski, p.

    <text>disaster' prevention, preparedness and action. awareness
    stimulated by well-publicised disasters has resulted in the
    development of prevention and preparedness plans and in better
    techniques for coping responsibly if the worst happens.
    understanding the natural hazards of an area, anticipating
    problems and maintaining buildings and grounds to withstand
    disaster may make a difference between total loss and damage.
    fire prevention is extremely important as fire not only
    destroys books but brings the possibility of massive volumes of
    water. considerations for preplanning include assigning
    specific tasks, knowing sources of supplies, lists of relevant
    telephone numbers, establishing priorities in the stock,
    developing plans for treating water- and fire-damaged materials
    and insurance. briefly looks at action to be taken if disaster

    <text>an algorithm for generating permutations an algorithm is

    permutations of k elements. only the previously generated
    permutation, the constant k, and a temporary index are needed.
    starting with a particular ordering of k elements (abcd),
    repeated application of the algorithm will generate k-1
    additional permutations by k-1 successive rotations. from the
    initial circular ordering of k objects, another circular
    ordering can be obtained by rotating the k-1 lowest elements.
    for each new k-1 circular ordering, another k-2 can be obtained
    by rotating the k-2 lowest elements. by continuing in this
    manner, applications of the algorithm will generate all (k-1)!
    circular orderings, or since each circular ordering yields k
    permutations the algorithm generates all k! permutations. may,

    <text>abiding by the law' legal materials in public libraries.
    increasingly, law materials are needed by an ever-widening

    the library should be the most convenient location for legal
    information. examines the public right of access to information

    could learn the rudiments of the liberal arts through the study

    <text>application of the soviet classification scheme in
    bulgaria's scientific libraries. since 1970, work has been in
    progress to gradually introduce the soviet classification
    scheme (referred to as bbk) into all types of libraries in
    bulgaria. the major responsibility for achieving this target
    has been that of the cyril and methodius national library in
    sofia supported by the national committee for culture and other
    bodies. the national library's staff have been principally
    involved in translating and editing the unabridged
    30-volume-bbk-version which has been published from 1973-81.
    the large scientific libraries will be catered for with this
    edition. public libraries, libraries in schools and others will
    be provided with abridged versions adapted for their special
    needs. various guide books, either translated from russian or
    written by bulgarian experts, will assist librarians to apply
    the bbk in the most effective way. an itemised account for
    introducing the bbk is given; it is emphasised, in particular,
    that the bbk is the only classification scheme based on

    surveys and programmes of library and information science
    curricula from 1969-75, discusses the professional continuity
    in changing courses. a particular problem is maintaining the
    identity of 'core studies' in professional curricula. the
    content and objectives of computer courses are listed and
    discussed. the coverage of the author's own survey is
    explained. all 17 schools in the uk, 1 in dublin and 13 in
    eastern usa and canada were visited in 1978 involving
    interviews with over 130 people individually or in groups. 10
    schools overseas provided further data in questionnaires. the
    results of the survey begin by summarising the various stated
    objectives for computer courses. there follows a review of the
    structure of such courses and the views on options in this
    subject. outlining the titles, content, duration and staf fing,
    reviews, with supporting tables, courses for computer
    appreciation, programming and library automation. separate
    tables and commentary cover the data from the questionnaires.
    in the conclusions, it is emphasised that computing is now an
    essential part of professional education, though how much and
    for whom is not yet decided. advanced courses will soon be
    needed for those wishing to specialise.</text>

    <text>problems in the standardisation of title entries in
    cataloguing networks. the development of a central title
    catalogue free of redundancies, and in which titles with
    multiple locational references occur only once, is possible
    within a cooperative cataloguing network, where the work load
    is distributed only through standardisation of the entry form.
    to achieve this, the detection and prevention of multiple
    references is especially important. describes the current
    status of network cataloguing in west germany, the
    monograph-cataloguing networks in north rhine westphalia,
    bavaria, and oclc. the more intensive investigation of these
    problems which thereby become apparent, regarding the
    establishment of uniform title entries, takes into account the
    technical aspects of data processing, specific library aspects,
    and organisational problems. thus can a realistic appraisal of
    the possibilities of using data processing in libraries be
    achieved.</text>

    pattern of library services available to staff in the uk
    national health service (n.h.s.) and gives a preliminary report
    of a study of library usage and of attitudes toward libraries
    among clinical and pre-clinical staff at oxford university.
    libraries serving n.h.s. staff are numerous but small, most
    commonly being staffed by a single librarian, and receive
    little publicity. in spite of their small size a significant
    number have a 'special library' character. teaching hospital
    libraries represent the intersection between the university and
    the n.h.s. library systems and are the largest of the libraries
    serving n.h.s. staff. data on usage and attitudes were
    collected by several different methods in the expectation that
    this would give a richer picture than would be provided by any
    one of conventional survey techniq ues. discusses the use of

    existing operators may be redefined. the processing of text
    containing defined contexts features a "replacement rule" that

    <text>abstract data types and software validation a data
    abstraction can be naturally specified using algebraic axioms.
    the virtue of these axioms is that they permit a
    representation-independent formal specification of a data type.
    an example is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms
    at successive levels of implementation. the major thrust of the
    paper is twofold. first, it is shown how the use of algebraic
    axiomatizations can simplify the process of proving the
    correctness of an implementation of an abstract data type.
    second, semi-automatic tools are described which can be used
    both to automate such proofs of correctness and to derive an
    immediate implementation from the axioms. this implementation
    allows for limited testing of programs at design time, before a
    conventional implementation is accomplished. december, 1978

    <text>fuzzy requests' an approach to weighted boolean searches.
    concerns the problem of how to permit a patron to represent the

    while retaining the desirable properties of a boolean system.
    classical boolean systems are reviewed and related to the
    notion of fuzzy sets. the fuzzy set concept then forms the
    basis of the concept of a fuzzy request in which weights are
    assigned to index terms. the properties of such a system are

    <text>the nucleus of a multiprogramming system this paper
    describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming
    system that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating
    systems to suit diverse requirements of program scheduling and
    resource allocation. the system nucleus simulates an
    environment in which program execution and input/output are
    handled uniformly as parallel, cooperating process es. a
    fundamental set of primitives allows the dynamic creation and
    control of a hierarchy of processes as well as the
    communication among them. april, 1970 hansen, p. b.

    of the british council library, delhi, a survey was conducted
    taking the books borrowed during 28 jan-9 feb 80 on mondays,
    wednesdays, fridays and saturdays as a sample. results of the
    survey have been presented with tables and charts. the survey
    indicates that the library is functioning effectively, and the
    students are the largest single group of users. however, there
    is strong discontent among all categories of borrowers about
    the modern fiction collection. it has been concluded that the

    <text>international development of information services in
    social sciences. many international organisations have
    participated in developing and coordinating information
    services in social sciences. some of these organisations have
    developed methods, and particular terminology. there is no
    established division of work between these organisations. it is
    important that information collected in different countries can
    be exchanged between different systems. the more mechanical
    this exchange is the more economical and faster it will be.
    unisist now also covers social sciences. a plan published in
    1972 includes unesco's programme for the development of
    information services in social sciences. unesco also supports
    financially some projects in the field, including ecssid
    programme. in 1975 oecd mapped the available information
    services in the field in europe. between 1971 and 1980 the
    british disiss project looked at the information services in
    social sciences and their quality. both projects concluded that
    information services have developed without any general
    long-term plan. 2 research projects in the field have been

    <text>a man-machine approach toward solving the traveling
    salesman problem the traveling salesman problem belongs to an
    important class of scheduling and routing problems. it is also
    a subproblem in solving others, such as the warehouse
    distribution problem. it has been attacked by many mathematical
    methods with but meager success. only for special forms of the
    problem or for problems with a moderate number of points can it
    be solved exactly, even if very large amounts of computer time
    are used. heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested
    with only slightly better results. this paper describes a
    computer aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest
    amount of computer time in real-time to solve large (100-200)
    point problems. this technique takes advantage of both the
    computer's and the human's problem-solving abilities. the
    computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way
    as in many of today's heuristics, but it is asked to organize
    the data for the human so that the human can solve the problem
    easily. the technique used in this paper seems to point to new
    directions in the field of man-machine interaction and in the
    field of artificial intelligence. may, 1971 krolak, p. felts,

    generalised to have a weighting capability are isolated. it is

    scheme satisfies most of the other properties associated with
    boolean algebra as well. probabilistic weighting is then
    introduced as an alternative approach and the 2 systems

    million items, loans over 79 million and readers over 3
    million. development has been slightly slower than during the
    previous 5 years, partly because a high standard had already
    been reached and partly because more organisational
    improvements were required. plans for stock expansion have gone
    ahead because the state publishing industry's production
    figures have increased. the planned total stock expansion
    figure has been exceeded and efforts were made to keep stocks
    up to date. total library expenditure in 1980 was 111,642,600

    <text>author cocitation: a literature measure of intellectual
    structure. shows that the mapping of a particular area of
    science, in this case information science, can be done using
    authors as units of analysis and the cocitations of pairs of
    authors as the variable that indicates their 'distances' from
    each other. the analysis assumes that the more 2 authors are
    cited together, the closer the relationship between them. the
    raw data are cocitation counts drawn on-line from social
    scisearch (2social sciences citation index1) over the period
    1972-79. cocitation analysis of authors offers a new technique
    that might contribute to the understanding of intellectual
    structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the
    extent that those areas rely on serial publications.</text>

    model for program behavior, and are source allocation strategy

    inhabitants. striking features of the central library include a
    quick reference and trade section of over 7,000 works and 7
    reference departments. the 45 branches divide into 4 regional
    groups in order to maintain close contact with the central
    library but yet retain a measure of independence. many cope
    with social problems, especially in the inner city area. an
    ethnic minorities librarian coordinates all services to foreign
    readers. study groups organise projects on reference material,
    library publications, radio programmes and staff training. in
    contrast with many german libraries, services for children are
    given particular prominence; in addition to sections in each
    branch library there are also 2 central children's

    <text>trace-driven modeling and analysis of cpu scheduling in
    multiprogramming system microscopic level job stream data
    obtained in a production environment by an event-driven
    software probe is used to drive a model of a multiprogramming
    computer system. the cpu scheduling algorithm of the model is
    systematically varied. this technique, called trace-driven
    modeling, provides an accurate replica of a production
    environment for the testing of variations in the system. at the
    same time alterations in scheduling methods can be easily
    carried out in a controlled way with cause and effects
    relationships being isolated. the scheduling methods tested
    included the best possible and worst possible methods, the
    traditional methods of multiprogramming theory, round-robin,
    first-come-first-served, etc., and dynamic predictors. the
    relative and absolute performances of these scheduling methods
    are given. it is concluded that a successful cpu scheduling
    method must be preemptive and must prevent a given job from
    holding the cpu for too long a period. december, 1972 sherman,

    topologies, and computed results are given for n &lt;= 7. an
    interesting side result of the computational work was the
    unearthing of a theoretical error which had been induced into
    the literature; the use of the computer in combinatorics
    represents, chronologically, an early application, and this
    side result underscores its continuing usefulness in this area.

    the danish librarians' union show that librarians know nothing
    about work in the technical departments and issue desks, where
    office trained staff, not librarians, work; they therefore tend
    to reject automation in these areas. they are, on the other
    hand, trained in bibliographical services and hence approve of
    automation of these. the fact is, however, that present manual
    issue control systems are working very poorly' books are being
    recalled which are already returned or have never been
    borrowed. refers to a neglected report of 1979 by a committee
    of heads of issue desks, which recommends experiments with
    automated issue control systems and in particular supports an
    automatic recall system. the issue desk staff of the automated
    olstykke library have also expressed positive views on their
    automatic system, views for which they have been reprimanded by
    the librarians' union.</text>

    <text>information education of pupils and the role of the
    teacher. the 'information education' of school children is not
    just the responsibility of librarians, but it should be an
    integral part of the modern teaching process in every subject.
    school libraries have traditionally operated on a rudimentary
    level as bookstocks with lending outlets-mostly supplying
    literature relevant to the teaching of the mother tongue. this
    is no longer adequate and school libraries must be transformed
    into up-to-date information and study centres. the slovak
    ministry of education has issued a directive no 3767/1979 which
    envisages school libraries fulfilling 3 roles' supplying
    library and information material to both teachers and pupils;
    contributing to the upbringing of the new socialist generation
    through working with books; educating both teachers and pupils
    to use information sources independently during individual
    study, career selection and leisure. acquisition must place
    greater emphasis on scientific, te chnical and other subject
    oriented books.</text>

    processes, resources, operating system, etc., of the "safe
    situations" which may be realized without endangering the
    smooth running of the system. when each process specifies its
    future needs by a flowchart of need-defined steps, a global
    approach to the phenomenon and its in terpretation as a game
    between the operating system and the processes allows
    formalization of risk and safety concepts. the bipartite graph
    representation of this game may then be used to construct
    explicitly the set of safe states and to study their
    properties. october, 1977 devillers, r. operating system,

    <text>generating english discourse from semantic networks a
    system is described for generating english sentences from a
    form of semantic nets in which the nodes are word-sense
    meanings and the paths are primarily deep case relations. the
    grammar used by the system is in the form of a network that
    imposes an ordering on a set of syntactic transformations that
    are expressed as lisp functions. the generation algorithm uses
    the information in the semantic network to select appropriate
    generation paths through the grammar. the system is designed
    for use as a computational tool that allows a linguist to
    develop and study methods for generating surface strings from
    an underlying semantic structure. initial finding with regard
    to form determiners such as voice, form, tense, and mood, some
    rules for embedding sentences, and some attention to pronominal
    substitution are reported. the system is programmed in lisp 1.5

    <text>aids unlimited' the scope for machine aids in a large
    organization. paper presented at the aslib technical
    translation group conference, london, 20 nov 80. examines the
    types of machine aid which are suitable for use in a large
    translating operation such as those met in the european
    community institutions. reviews the way in which these machine
    aids are already being used in large organisations and examines
    the areas in which they can be of benefit to the running of the
    whole organisation. warns of possible difficulties in
    introducing them. if these difficulties can be overcome, many
    advantages can be gained in a large organisation by introducing
    a fully-integrated word-processing system in which all texts
    are stored in electronic archives and can be transmitted
    electronically from 1 work station to another, and from 1
    country to another.</text>

    cooperation is gaining momentum, it is particularly important
    for small countries to decide on their priorities in developing
    international cooperative links; and information specialists
    must acquire, early in their training, an attitude of

    <text>the laconiq monitor: time sharing for online dialogues
    the laconiq (laboratory computer online inquiry) monitor was
    developed primarily to support non-numerical applications such
    as retrieval from very large files by means of a "dialogue"
    between a system user and a retrieval application. the monitor
    was designed so that it could work with a small computer (an
    ibm system 360/30). therefore techniques for resource
    allocation were important. for this reason the use of core
    storage, computational facilities, and input-output were all
    scheduled. an unusual feature of the system is that it is
    event-driven rather than clock-driven. the program segments
    called into execution by the remote crt consoles are invariably
    run to completion rather than "rolled-out" to be brought back
    at a later time. december, 1967 drew, d. l. ca671202 jb

    <text>leadership by nonadministrators in academic libraries.
    leadership by those not in positions of authority in libraries
    has usually been discussed in terms of participation in
    management. a number of other models are given' participation
    and feedback models, including the evaluation of superiors;
    models of confrontation and risk taking, including action to
    overcome mismanagement and assertion of employees' rights; and
    models for change agents, including use of staff organisations,
    informal action networks, and resource exchange networks. the
    theory is that a 'servant leadership' by lower and middle level
    staff may promote service by libraries and also increase
    attention to the importance of the work to the staff
    themselves. the action models should be tested and related to a
    career-stage model which identifies power and influence by
    those who are not managers.</text>

    <text>periodicals for the disabled' their importance as
    information sources. recent federal legislation mandates
    integration of disabled americans into the mainstream of
    society. thus, there is a need for more information about the
    physically disabled. librarians and other professionals must
    gain an understanding of the perspectives and concerns of
    disabled people, and this is best gained from personal contact.
    where this is not possible, reading of the periodical
    literature published for and by the disabled is recommended.
    these periodicals have changed as the information demands of
    the disabled have evolved, and they offer information not found
    elsewhere. they can educate librarians, rehabilitation workers
    and the public about the needs and abilities of the disabled in
    the usa.</text>

    <text>responsibility, development and community. a talk given
    at a course on leadership-public libraries at the local
    authorities' high school, nov 81. discusses politicians'
    expectations of the library and its staff. cooperation between
    local politicians and librarians is often hampered by the
    librarians' preference for centrally imposed norms instead of
    adaptation to local needs. but imposition of obligations takes
    away spontaneity. objects to self-appointed moralists guiding
    the people's cultural needs in a certain ideological direction.
    comprehensiveness, one of the library objectives, cannot be on
    the basis of a particular book, which must necessarily present
    a particular viewpoint, but must be an overall guideline. the
    library law, like modern education and social laws, should
    specify an obligation to development planning in the individual
    authority, not lay down external structural norms without
    regard to local conditions. the leading librarian and the
    leading head teacher must have equal say on the cultural
    committee to secure libraries' independence from an
    administrative leader from the education service. libraries
    must nourish the qualified doubt and supply the means for
    constructive criticism of expert knowledge necessary in the
    democratic decision making process. libraries and local
    politicians must cooperate in keeping art and culture
    independent of political and commercial influence.</text>

    <text>campania' aspects of the library situation. a
    comprehensive description of existing services in a southern
    italian region before the earthquake in nov 80, showing the
    total inadequacy of library provision, and absence of any
    official recognition of the need for legislative initiatives
    and a comprehensive policy to develop services and provide
    training for librarians. reliable statistics are unavailable,
    but sufficient evidence is presented to demonstrate that both
    in naples and throughout the region, the majority of libraries
    are restricted to university users or other privileged groups,
    and public access to reading is extremely limited. any
    activities to develop library services have been isolated
    initiatives, without recognition of the importance of the role
    of the library in the community; expansion is haphazard and the
    concepts of library cooperation and network planning utterly
    unknown. suggestions are made for the creation of regional
    centres as a 1st step in ameliorating the situati on. a note
    calls attention to the increased urgency for action following
    destruction of library buildings by earthquake, and an appendix
    deals with the problems of rescuing archives now at risk
    because of earthquake damage.</text>

    <text>new lisp techniques for a paging environment the system
    described herein employs the block concept, and that of global
    and local variables, in addition to the methods applied in most
    lisp systems. also, a new means of list representation is used:
    "local sequential" for lists created during compilation, and
    "block level sequential" for those created dynamically. a new
    garbage collection algorithm has been introduced to make lists
    as compact as possible; partial garbage collection is performed
    after each block exit instead of total garbage collection when
    storage is exhausted. the algorithm does not use the customary
    flagging procedure. this combination of features has eliminated
    the need for a free list, and effectively minimizes the number
    of pages used at any moment. december, 1971 rochfeld, a. lisp,

    <text>an executive system implemented as a finite-state
    automaton the 473l command and control system used by the air
    force permits many operators to access large data files through
    the use of a computer. the man-machine interface is satisfied
    by several communication consoles from which operators may
    enter queries and view replies. a data link permits remote
    stations to send messages, status reports and inventories
    directly to the computer. the information received over the
    on-line data link is used to update the data files which are
    stored on disk. the 473l programming system is divided into an
    executive control program and five components with different
    processing priorities. these priorities permit the system to be
    most sensitive to the console inputs and permit the operators
    at all the consoles to time share the central processor. the
    executive control program provides for the orderly transitions
    of control among the programming system components. the major
    emphasis of the paper is on the technique of using the
    definition of a finite-state automaton for organizing the
    executive control program. november, 1964 heistand, r. e.

    <text>a review of the development and potential of the public
    library system in east africa. (mls dissertation.) to examine
    whether the high technology library system favoured by the west
    is applicable to developing countries, it is necessary to study
    the history of public library development in a particular area,
    its current status, and its planned future development. the
    east african community (kenya, uganda, and tanzania) was chosen
    for this study as its library development has been sufficiently
    long to enable a cause-and-effect analysis. in future, there
    must be a balance between acceptance of apposite western ideas
    and rejection of those ideas harmful to the community.
    financial support is becoming more assured; the recognition of
    local requirements must follow.</text>

    <text>automation of etching-pattern layout help (heuristic

    developed to computerize the tedious and error-prone although
    vitally important wiring design of printed circuit boards. help
    helps automate a design stage one step closer to production
    than logical design. it can be used to design wiring patterns
    of two-layer circuit boards on which ics in dual-in-line
    packages as well as discrete components such as transistors and
    resistors have been placed. help employs two methods of wiring.
    one is the heuristic method, which simulates human approaches
    to wiring design, and the other is the theoretically
    interesting but time-consuming method of maze-running, based on
    the lee's algorithm. help performs more than 90 percent of
    required wiring by the heuristic path with respect to a
    performance function for each point-to-point, and point-to-line
    connection. it can bring the number of successful wiring
    connections very close to 100 percent. november, 1971 aramaki,

    <text>the library bill and the danish library association. the
    official statement of the danish library association on the
    ministry of culture's library bill of 24 sept 81. the
    association supports this proposal, but with some reservations.
    thus it supports the inclusion of both public and research
    libraries in one act, but opposes the decision to remove school
    libraries. it supports the proposed amalgamation of the library
    inspectorate and the office of national librarian, and the
    establishment of a library council, albeit with a different
    composition. it would have liked to see art collections put on
    a par with music collections, and library provision for
    intermediate education and outreach activities made obligatory.
    the library centre, of whose board the association has a
    majority membership, is willing to cooperate in discussions on
    the administration of the national bibliography and urges that
    its financing be clarified soon. the association regards the
    amount set aside for transition of p art-time libraries to
    full-time status too low. it supports the change to block grant

    the euronet telecommunications network is a packet based data
    network initially provided to enable low cost access to be
    obtained to scientific, technical and socio-economic data bases
    within the european economic community. it has however served
    as a means to standardise data communications protocols
    throughout the community and has provided a stimulus for
    telecommunications administrations to establish not only
    national networks which when interconnected will enable the
    initial euronet network to be absorbed, but also new services
    capable of utilising packet switched networks. the planned
    availability of these networks on a european scale is now
    providing a stimulus to manufacturers of data terminals to make
    available new ranges of equipment capable of exploiting the
    special facilities offered by a packet based network for
    message transmission and euronet could provide a testbed to

    <text>an efficient context-free parsing algorithm a parsing
    algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general
    context-free algorithm known is described. it is similar to
    both knuth's lr(k) algorithm and the familiar top-down
    algorithm. it has a time bound proportional to n^3 (where n is
    the length of the string being parsed) in general; it has a n^2
    bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a
    large class of grammars, which seems to include most practical
    context-free programming language grammars. in an empirical
    comparison it appears to be superior to the top-down and
    bottom-up algorithms studied by griffiths and petrick.

    <text>the possibilities and limitations of local government
    development plans for libraries. lecture given at the annual

    libraries, berlin 1980. the euphoria from library planning in
    the 1970s has now faded, leaving behind scepticism as to
    whether the plans can be carried out. library planning without
    a legal basis is not binding; the law should provide a legal
    framework, local authority planning the detailed description of
    concrete aims. planning stages are described with reference to
    the frankfurt-am-main library development plan of 1972. library
    planning is particularly important in times of financial
    difficulty; a local authority's financial capacity must be
    considered in order to avoid cost inflation. library plans can

    <text>a translating computer interface for end-user operation
    of heterogeneous retrieval systems. 1. design. on-line
    retrieval systems may be difficult to use, especially by end
    users, because of heterogeneity and complexity. investigations
    have concerned the concept of a translating computer interface
    as a means to simplify access to, and operation of,
    heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems and data bases.
    the interface allows users to make requests in a common
    language. these requests are translated by the interface into
    the appropriate commands for whatever system is being
    interrogated. system responses may also be transformed by the
    interface into a common form before being given to the users.
    thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a
    single 'virtual' system to the user. the interface also
    provides instruction and other search aids for the user.
    philosophy, design and implementation of an experimental
    interface named conit are described.</text>

    modelling, the identification of sea creatures and some
    children's fiction. every evening the children and teachers
    used these books as a complement to the day's activities. as a
    result the library staff developed close contact with some
    teachers and pupils who had hitherto been seen only rarely in
    the library. some of these children who had tended to misbehave
    in the school library were shown to better advantage in the
    holiday situation. story sessions were also organised and were
    received enthusiastically, even by children who had previously
    shown little interest in literature.</text>

    <text>on empirical foundations of information science. in this
    study of empirical foundations of information science,
    pertinent empirical laws and hypotheses, which have been
    reported in scientific and technical literature, were
    catalogued, described, and analysed for their dependencies and
    relationships. the main objective of research was to identify a
    body of knowledge, derived from empirical observations of
    information phenomena and representative of information science
    as a distinct scientific discipline. this body of knowledge
    deals with concepts such as information value, relevance, aging
    of information, growth of knowledge, obsolescence, information
    scatter, productivity of information sources and information

    <text>for greater efficiency of regional library services.
    compared with 1939, there are 4 times as many libraries in
    bulgaria catering for 32 times as many readers. book
    collections-almost 83 million volumes at present-have increased
    34 times. bulgaria comes 5th in the world as to the number of
    books per head of population. in spite of these encouraging
    statistics, the state control committee made an investigation
    recently into the structure, organisation and efficiency of
    library services in 7 regions. the availability of public,
    school and trade union libraries varied greatly. inhabitants on
    some of the new housing estates have been deprived up to now of
    any kind of library services. there were cases of haphazard
    opening and/or closing of libraries. there is still a lack of
    information and reference services, shortages in consistent
    cataloguing and proper upkeep of rarities, recovery of overdue
    books, as well as inadequate audio-visual and reprographic
    equipment. better planning for acquisiti ons, and also more
    considerate discarding of obsolete items are most desirable.
    the committee's findings will be presented to local government
    and other relevant bodies whose members have to take a much
    more active interest in libraries in their regions, in
    particular in rural areas.</text>

    <text>problems and tasks of libraries in higher education.
    libraries in higher education must make the most of their
    existing premises as construction of new library buildings has
    been severely restricted, at least for the time being. however,
    in spite of the conditions, library and information services
    must be under constant review with their improvement in mind.
    branches established in the students' halls of residence have
    to provide all students with basic study literature. the
    central library of any particular establishment has to cater
    for centralised and coordinated acquisitions and processing.
    use of literature by students and teaching staff must also be
    followed up and obsolete items discarded. greater attention
    must be paid to political and other literature dealing with
    social sciences, especially in faculties of applied science. it
    is important to support aesthetic education by audio-visual
    materials. the role of computerised information systems, now on
    a trial basis in schools of econ omics, will grow in future.
    for expert advice libraries in higher education have to look
    above all to the university library in sofia with its
    methodological department and special councils in many spheres
    of knowledge.</text>

    the question: do i&amp;r services, occupants of boundary
    positions vis-a-vis social organisations, serve as sources of
    information inputs from the environment for country social
    service agencies? findings show that i&amp;r data are important
    sources of information from the environment for most of the
    agencies surveyed, dependent not only on organisational
    supports but also on feedback processes that encourage
    information exchange between organisations and their
    environment. such developments must be guided by an
    understanding of the kinds of questions such data can answer
    and thoughtful analysis of the data.</text>

    maps alphabetically by state and quadrangle name, but adjacent
    quadrangles are then not filed together. alvin mclane,
    consultant, devised a new system' the mclane system' using the
    2usgs index to topographic maps1, each 15-minute quadrangle is
    numbered consecutively from west to east starting from the
    northwest corner of the state with number one, and assigning
    numbers to quadrangles regardless of whether they have been
    mapped. describes the advantages and flexibility, and some of
    the disadvantages of the system. for a local or regional

    system would be minimal and the rewards of ea se of accessing

    <text>the public library and social demand in brazil. a paper
    delivered at a 1978 brazilian conference discussing the failure
    of public libraries to become an accepted community
    institution. considers their actual state at present' housed in
    substandard buildings, under-resourced, staffed by untrained
    personnel, and used mainly by students. the imported model of
    the public library serving the needs of all the community is
    inappropriate to the social reality in brazil, where social
    structure is based on class division. statistics are presented
    to show the extent of potential demand, but despite recent
    expansion of services, and the growth of publishing, the
    population of non-users remains constant, and reading continues
    to be an elite leisure activity. the initiation of a cultural
    policy to break the chains of social dependence and develop
    plans for society as a whole is advocated.</text>

    aphasics, the blind, and the mentally retarded were discussed.
    materials to handicapped readers were described on the basis of
    an analysis of the reading skill, the definition of an easy
    text, and the different needs of the variously handicapped. the
    need to create a barrier-free library by good planning and

    <text>library automation in the united states of america.
    covers the past, present and future of library automation in
    the usa. begins with the establishment of networks, describing
    the role of oclc and adoption of marc. the 2nd step is seen as
    the growth of on-line data bases, with particular reference to
    lockheed, sdc and brs. costs, though, have deterred full use of
    these. makes a case for standardisation of formats. the effect
    of on-line systems on retrieval is related to the increasing
    interest in document delivery systems. notes the contribution
    of mini- and microcomputers to this area. centralised shared
    systems have allowed automation to progress. all this needs
    paralleling in the library schools which have difficulty in
    providing the facilities. the real problem lies in making
    systems user friendly. perhaps librarians should cultivate
    self-sufficiency in programming, using easy high-level
    languages like forth and speakeasy. word processors also will
    need to be a standard part of library equipment. the future
    must lie in achieving access to all information from a
    terminal.</text>

    analyses language and the development of a semantic theory that
    would help explain the process of inquiry; demonstrates that
    even such straightforward uses of language as authors' names
    and citations are very complex linguistic phenomena; analyses
    general methods used in the conduct of inquiry; and identifies

    <text>dialog: a conversational programming system with a

    a computational aid for the casual user, which provides basic
    facilities for graphical and numeric input and display, online
    and off line program preparation and storage, and hard copy
    presentation of results. use of the system requires a minimum
    of experience or instruction, since the growth of an overlaying
    system control language has been prevented, and there are no
    processor-oriented statements, like variable type or dimension
    declarations. moreover, in the online situation the processor
    interacts with the graphical keyboard on a
    character-by-character basis so as to restrict the programmer's
    choice of input symbols to those which are syntactically
    correct. dialog has been in daily operation at the iit research

    <text>application of an entropy measure for journal evaluation

    citing journal package of 2journal citation reports1, a new
    quantitative measure having a theoretical basis (entropy
    measure) was tested. the results were compared with those of 4
    other measures representing an empirical approach. all 5 sets
    of results were compared with core journal lists and a peer
    review ranking of some of the titles. the 5 measures seemed to
    represent different journal properties. the entropy measure
    involved the brillouin information measure (the contribution of
    a journal to the communication network related to a journal

    <text>a technique for isolating differences between files a
    simple algorithm is described for isolating the differences
    between two files. one application is the comparing of two
    versions of a source program or other file in order to display
    all differences. the algorithm isolates differences in a way
    that corresponds closely to our intuitive notion of difference,
    is easy to implement, and is computationally efficient, with
    time linear in the file length. for most applications the
    algorithm isolates differences similar to those isolated by the
    longest common subsequence. another application of this
    algorithm merges files containing independently generated
    changes into a single file. the algorithm can also be used to
    generate efficient encodings of a file in the form of the
    differences between itself and a given "datum" file, permitting
    reconstruction of the original file from the difference and
    datum files. april, 1978 heckel, p. difference isolation, word

    lorenskog central library, norway, was established in school
    premises in 1967 as a combined public/school library. from the
    1st it was too small and the combination proved unsatisfactory.
    in 1971 a reorganisation plan for the library service included
    a new central library. after several years of postponements,
    worsening conditions and staff protests, the library rented 650
    sq.m. in a new office block-more than double its existing
    accommodation, though half the space proposed in 1971-and
    opened there in summer 80. loans have risen by 85%. lack of
    staff necessitates a reduction of 9 hours per week in opening

    pilot project based on limited data and an unaltered search
    system' the library school's subject retrieval system (bes).
    the phase has the following components' 1. transfer of
    catalogue entries from kommunedata to recku (the regional
    computer centre of copenhagen university). 2. change of format
    from the bc format (danmarc) to the bes format; lists the bes
    search codes used, with an example. 3. building up of search
    registers, with list of taboo words. 4. demonstration runs.
    concludes that phase 0 has shown that data compiled for use in
    printed catalogues can be used in an on-line system. some
    problems in connection with input of foreign language items
    remain. the system enables search via dk5, author and title
    like manual catalogues, but also terms in the title and note
    fields and other combinations. although subject searches were

    examples of fap and snobol flowcharts are given. however, it is
    not necessary to confine one's scope to existing languages. one
    may define his own language in any "well-structured" manner.
    this feature is particularly useful when it is desirable to
    chart only comments within a program. such an approach permits
    the documentation of descriptive remarks and avoids the

    <text>the accuracy of telephone reference services in the
    southeast' a case for quantitative standards. the telephone
    reference services of public and private college and university
    libraries in the 9 southeastern states of the usa were
    investigated using their responses to 12 fact-seeking telephone
    queries made over a 12-month period, their 1975 library general
    information survey data, and a questionnaire designed to
    identify independent variables related to reference services.
    only 50% of the test questions were answered correctly.
    independent variables such as service hours or volumes held
    were more closely related to accuracy of response than
    variables concerned with staff, indicating that staff ability
    to exploit a collection is more crucial than staff numbers.
    concludes that these results support calls for quantitative
    standards for reference services.</text>

    <text>designing optical mark forms for reference statistics.
    data are recorded on optical mark forms using a soft pencil to
    place a series of marks in specified areas, a technique that is
    commonly used on examination answer sheets. the data are then
    available for computer tabulation and analysis. reference-desk
    statistics can efficiently be collected in machine-readable
    form by using such a technique. information relevant to the
    design of an optical mark form is presented along with
    important software considerations. the overriding concern when
    designing an optical mark form to be used at the reference desk
    is to provide the ability to record all necessary information
    while requiring as few marks as possible. useful data
    categories are identified, and figures illustrate how data can
    be recorded for each category. presents information resulting

    for estimating quadrature errors for analytic functions were

    rounded values for the abscissas and weights and since the true
    values of the integrals of some of the polynomials in question
    have an infinite binary expression, the quadrature rule is not

    <text>archival education and training in the united states,
    1937 to present. from almost its inception in 1937, archival
    education and training has been primarily a post-employment
    effort. this is attributed to the indifference of the
    professional associations in both the fields of librarianship
    and history, the 2 main disciplines from which manuscript
    librarians and archivists are drawn. between 1937-40 and
    1967-70, the american library association became peripherally
    interested. the history profession has become more active since
    the early 1970s in its search for alternative careers for
    aspiring historians. individual library schools also have been
    offering archival management courses since the early 1960s
    particularly. by lacking academic status, the american
    literature in the archival field has also been underdeveloped,
    and this has contributed to the slowness in developing adequate
    intellectual control of archival/manuscript sources. an attempt
    in 1967-70 to develop an archival manual withi n a.l.a. died
    aborning and the historical associations and society of
    american archivists have just begun to cope with the problem
    independently. practicing archivists of necessity will continue
    to be the main teacher pool and contributors to the literature
    until regular faculty in library schools and history
    departments have been adequately trained, but 1st a basic
    reorientation must occur that recognises that records and
    papers of contemporary society are the central problem.</text>

    <text>tele-cupl: a telephone time sharing system a general
    purpose, remote access, computing system is described, that
    employs twelve-key keyboard telephones as terminals. audio
    output is provided directly to the telephone terminals, but the
    system will normally be used in conjunction with remotely
    located high speed printing devices. the system is a compatible
    extension of an existing batch processing system. a significant
    element of the system is a scheme for transmitting alphanumeric
    information by single strokes on a numeric keyboard. the
    programmed scanner uses context to eliminate the ambiguity in
    transmission. september, 1967 conway, r. w. morgan, h. l.

    have recently been concerned in a time-series study that
    constituted a fairly typical piece of applied statistical
    research, involving extensive computations on a moderately

    numerical processes that were required could be built up almost
    completely from a small number of basic operations, and a set
    of fortran subroutines has been written to perform these. the
    main purpose of this note is to describe these subroutines, but
    since the question of general statistical programs is topical
    [1], we include some general remarks. january, 1963 healy, m.

    size of collections; subject-headings lists used; indexes
    required; subject areas where dewey did not meet norwegian
    requirements; and additional aids desirable. the aim was to
    chart norwegian use of dewey and obtain help towards a new
    edition of arnesen and in the committee's future work. of 117
    libraries which replied, 77 used dewey and/or arnesen, many
    supplementing arnesen from other sources. several libraries
    specified problem fields, arnesen being found weakest in
    classes 300, 700 and 900. proposals included microcard indexes;
    current subject card catalogues; classification on publication;
    and periodical publication with continuing updating. the survey
    revealed a clear need for a new, extended edition of arnesen,

    citation analysis. citation analysis of faculty publications,
    doctoral dissertations, and preliminary doctoral qualifying
    briefs produced by faculty and students of the biology
    department, temple university, is used to assess journal use in
    the biology library during the years 1975-77. there are 3,739
    citations to 336 journals in the combined sources ranking. the
    distribution of citations in each user group ranking and the
    combined sources ranking takes the form of a bradford
    distribution. 60 highly cited titles are examined in detail.
    dissertation citations are dependent on active faculty
    participation in the doctoral programme. citations in
    qualifying briefs cover a broader range of topics and interests
    than either of the other 2 sources. citation frequencies of
    volumes published in the periods 1960-69 and 1970-77 are
    examined. several collection maintenance and development
    decisions have been made, based on the results of this study.
    citation analysis is shown to be a useful tool in assessing

    <text>use of microfilm in french provincial archives.
    thirty-five years' experience. following a preliminary detailed
    account of the introduction of microfilm in french provincial
    archives and its gradual integration into normal archive
    management practice, with reference to the elaboration of
    official norms and regulations for use, statistical evidence of
    the expansion of the photographic service is given, showing
    progressive increase in workshop space, specialist personnel
    employed, and microfilm footage production, with reference to
    relevant state publications. the recently implemented programme
    of duplicating important holdings is briefly described, and
    comments made on attitudes in general to use of microfilm,
    positive and negative. concludes that to maintain efficiency,
    the french archive service needs to keep abreast of
    technological development, secure its financial basis, and
    solve the legal problems of reprography.</text>

    <text>topographic map acquisition in us academic libraries.
    presents the results of a recent survey of topographical map
    acquisition in us academic libraries, and discusses the status
    of, and trends in, topographical map acquisition programmes.
    concludes that the level of acquisition of this mapping is
    remarkably low compared to the stated demand for it, and that
    the situation regarding foreign material is especially
    critical. identifies the major collecting problems as' loss of
    depository receipts; inadequate funding support; inflated map
    prices; increased production; and government restrictions.
    suggests that these problems could be resolved by obtaining
    better internal and external support through planning,
    organised action, and cooperative efforts, and highlights the
    need for library administrators to recognise the resource value
    of topographic mapping.</text>

    produced. student were not allowed to borrow books for home
    reading, although professors could do so, and professors often
    stood bail for those who defaulted on the restrictions.
    librarians were chosen from amongst the university's most

    consists of first determining the minimal-perimeter convex

    rectangle of minimum area capable of containing this polygon.
    three theorems are introduced to show that one side of the
    minimum-area rectangle must be colinear with an edge of the
    enclosed polygon and that the minimum-area encasing rectangle
    for the convex polygon is also the minimum-area rectangle for

    patron success with locating serials have been uncommon. this
    study, conducted at a separate serial card catalogue in a major
    research library, measures the success of more than 400 patrons
    in the bibliographic retrieval of serials. the authors
    interviewed patrons and then analyzed the data in an attempt to
    determine how patrons approach a card catalogue when searching
    for serials, their success rate, and reasons for their

    <text>has the discussion about school libraries finished?.
    since the early 19th century, the value of a centrally situated
    school library open to the general public and encouraging a
    life-long learning process has been widely discussed. the
    discussion received fresh impetus after 1970 with the
    development of usa, uk and scandinavian school media centres
    and renewed interest in the social and educational functions of
    school libraries. classrooms must be closely connected with the
    school media centre; their evolution into class media centres
    has only occurred so far in primary schools, a change demanding
    good organisation and close links with the public library
    system. the triangular relationship classroom-school media
    centre-public library can be equated with emunds' '3-tier'

    favour of cooperative networks and at the same time there was
    the rise of the phenomenon of on-line data base reference
    services such as dialog. considerable attention was given to
    the development of multi-media learning resources centres.
    library administration became less hierarchical in the early
    1970s with more trade union involvement in evidence. the
    worsening economic situation after 1974 left its mark with the
    drying up of library vacancies and noticeable pressure on
    library resources.</text>

    <text>the legal deposit legislation as the basis of the

    paper presented at the 1st swedish-soviet seminar on 'the
    national library within a country's library and information
    services' development prospects' held in moscow, 21-22 nov 78.
    after a short introduction into the history of legal deposit
    legislation in scandinavia, concentrates on its development in
    sweden. new legal deposit law came into force in 1979, the
    previous legislation having been passed in 1949. the 2 laws are
    compared and differences between them and reasons for the
    introduction of the new law are discussed. the new law brings
    changes not only in the number of copies publishers will now
    have to deposit of books (now 7, previously 5) but also widens
    the range of deposit materials. administrative procedures
    connected with the deposits are mentioned.</text>

    <text>the library situation in england' increasing demand for
    self-financing of service improvements. examines the state of
    libraries in the uk. during the last 5 years public libraries
    especially have been subject to cuts resulting in fewer
    acquisitions, closure of branches, reduced opening hours and
    freezing of staff posts. at the same time attempts are made to
    increase income through increased fines and sale of discarded
    material and pamphlets, although lending fees have not yet been
    imposed. introduction of automation in libraries is seen by
    many as a means of reducing staff expenditure and improving
    services to the public, especially commerce and industry. the
    library provision for children, never very good compared to
    danish public libraries, has been struck particularly hard by
    the cuts. the reaction against the cuts has been led by nalgo
    in the form of work stoppages and by the library association as
    protests to the authorities.</text>

    <text>libraries, radio and television in work with young
    people. there are 3 main ways in which libraries and the media
    can cooperate. radio and television can broadcast relevant
    programmes such as discussions, interviews with authors and
    story readings. librarians can use television and radio to
    focus the attention of young people on particular issues,
    recommending programmes and linking book displays to them.
    alternatively, librarians can be actually involved in the
    production of programmes and can use them to publicise popular
    literature and authors. a survey, undertaken in rostov, showed
    how effective this form of cooperation could be, but it is

    <text>current public library legislation in

    commission on the reform of danish public library legislation
    presented its report in 1979, proposing a library act covering
    both public and special libraries, with a joint library
    directorate. all library stocks should be available through an
    inter-library loan centre. the national bibliography, at
    present produced in sections, should be taken over by the
    state. the free lending principle is maintained. public
    libraries, after a 5-year transitional period, should be wholly
    financed by the local authorities within 2 years. music
    libraries should be obligatory. proposed changes for special
    libraries emphasise a need for coordination. responsibility for
    school libraries would be transferred to the educational system
    under a recent act, in an attempt to unify the library system.
    all educational institutions would be obliged to establish and
    administer libraries suitable for their needs.</text>

    <text>proving termination with multiset orderings a common tool
    for proving the termination of programs is the well-founded
    set, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite
    descending sequences. the basic approach is to find a
    termination function that maps the values of the program
    variables into some well-founded set, such that the value of
    the termination function is repeatedly reduced throughout the
    computation. all too often, the termination functions required
    are difficult to find and are of a complexity out of proportion
    to the program under consideration. multisets (bags) over a
    given well-founded set s are sets that admit multiple
    occurrences of elements taken from s. the given ordering on s
    induces an ordering on the finite multisets over s. this
    multiset ordering is shown to be well-founded. the multiset
    ordering enables the use of relatively simple and intuitive
    termination functions in otherwise difficult termination
    proofs. in particular, the multiset ordering is used to prove
    the termination of production systems, programs defined in
    terms of sets of rewriting rules. august, 1979 dershowitz, n.

    <text>hidden lines elimination for a rotating object a method
    is presented of determining which parts of three-dimensional
    objects are visible and which are invisible when the objects
    are rotated about some axis. this paper describes a polygon
    comparison scheme in which the relationships of two polygons
    can be classified into tree types, and also discusses how the
    relationship is changed for each pair of polygons under
    rotation about some axis. a rotation table is defined for each
    pair of polygons, which remains fixed as long as rotation is
    about one axis and provides a means of rapidly determining the
    visible and hidden line relationship between two polygons.
    additional work must be done to extend this approach to
    simultaneous rotation about several axes. april, 1972

    <text>the vatican library. describes the vatican library.
    despite numerous plunders and dispersals of the collections the
    library has grown under the care of many library cardinals and
    popes. thus on the death of pope nicholas v in 1455 it
    contained europe's largest manuscript collection. the official
    foundation was laid with sixtus iv's bull in 1475, the
    collection was organised in 4 parts, and the 1st catalogue
    appeared in 1485. a liberal lending policy was stopped for all
    time by sixtus v, who also had the present building erected in
    1588. expansion forced the library to occupy rooms other than
    the original sistine saloon. the 20th century has seen
    modernisation of the building and of administrative and library
    techniques. the library contains among many precious
    manuscripts the collection belonging to queen christina of
    sweden. cataloguing of manuscripts, incunabula and printed
    books has been going on since the 15th century.</text>

    <text>library as a municipal information centre. a survey

    are not using libraries to display information. librarians
    themselves are passive about acquiring any materials on local
    affairs. only 14% of them had contacts with some local

    administrator presiding over a research library and a public

    research libraries at present under a different ministry from
    the ministry of culture, will remain outside the central
    control, although general development planning for all research
    libraries is to be centrally administered. there will be no
    direct state financial support for public libraries in general,
    but some specified libraries and activities will receive state

    <text>purchasing keys' methods of carrying out ideas on

    stock-building, even if it is the most important. a purchasing
    key is a coding system for the practical application of these
    principles; experiences in magdeburg have proved the key to be
    a useful rationalisation method. through the coding symbols the
    librarian can see quickly what types of literature are in which
    libraries in the network. the symbols are flexible and can
    easily be kept up to date. other stock-building criteria are
    literary merit, specialist demand, functions of individual
    libraries in the network, numbers of readers, space and

    australian institute of technology library (known as the t.l.
    robertson library). during the 1970s, the acquisitions budget
    was adequate; this is now questionable. discusses the budget
    control options available to the library and suggests a
    flexible approach to subject budgets, a portion of the
    monograph budget being earmarked for special needs and the
    remaining larger share being apportioned to the subject
    areas.</text>

    <text>library description' where muses are preserved-the dutch
    literary museum and archives centre. the nederlands
    letterkundig museum en documentatiecentrum was founded in the
    hague in 1953. the museum was greatly expanded in 1954 by a
    former city archivist of the hague, dr. w. moll, who deposited
    on permanent loan his private collection of 360 boxes of
    material relating to about 1,500 dutch authors. the collection
    now contains manuscripts, corrected proofs, publishers'
    contracts, book illustrations, portraits and gramophone and
    tape-recordings relating to dutch authors of the post-1750
    period. the museum is financed partly by the dutch government
    and partly by the city council and has an annual purchase grant
    of approximately *64,000. in 1982 the museum will be rehoused
    in the new royal library buildings at present nearing
    completion in the hague.</text>

    <text>with book analyses against morgan kane. the final session

    librarians dealt with book knowledge, evaluation and selection.
    based on general novels, it also included high quality and
    popular literature, introducing systematic book analysis and
    professional terminology. assigning novels to genres with the
    aim of supplying alternatives to substandard literature (such
    as morgan kane) was seen as being particularly useful. the art
    of skimming through a book and grasping its essentials was
    practised. study of book reviews revealed that evaluations of
    the same book can differ widely. aids to book selection
    (especially important to rural librarians with no local

    planned routing-typically, down from the upper pin, through a
    via, and horizontally to the lower pin. from the top, a virtual
    aperture (i.e. a long horizontal slit) is stepped down the
    board. the planned routing is the basis for rerouting
    interconnections within the aperture to resolve conflicts for
    lines and vias below the aperture and to maximize the effective
    line usage. if a conflict has not been resolved before the
    aperture arrives at the lower pin,interconnections are deleted
    to resolve the conflict. extensions of this technique to the
    control of crosstalk between routed interconnections and to the
    problem of obtaining 100 percent interconnect are also
