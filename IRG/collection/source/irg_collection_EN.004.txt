    <text>proof techniques for hierarchically structured programs a
    method for describing and structuring programs that simplifies
    proofs of their correctness is presented. the method formally
    represents a program in terms of levels of abstraction, each
    level of which can be described by a self-contained
    nonprocedural specification. the proofs, like the programs, are
    structured by levels. although only manual proofs are described
    in the paper, the method is also applicable to semi-automatic
    and automatic proofs. preliminary results are encouraging,
    indicating that the method can be applied to large programs,
    such as operating systems. april, 1977 robinson, l. levitt, k.

    <text>control structures in illiac iv fortran as part of an

    iv, an extended fortran, called ivtran, has been developed.
    this language provides a means of expressing data and control
    structures suitable for exploiting illiac iv parallelism. this
    paper reviews the hardware characteristics of the illiac and
    singles out unconventional features which could be expected to
    influence language (and compiler) design. the implications of
    these features for data layout and algorithm structure are
    discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that data allocation
    rather than code structuring is the crucial illiac optimization
    problem. a satisfactory method of data allocation is then
    presented. language structures to utilize this storage method
    and express parallel algorithms are described. october, 1973

    to the ministry of education and culture, 1 in the israel state
    archives, 1 in the knesset library and 2 in the jewish national
    and university library (jnul). the present law does not cover
    non-book material; editions are not strictly defined; there is
    no way to prove delinquency in deposit of books during the
    statutory period of 1 month; the fines are not high enough to
    deter publishers; and the procedures for instigating legal
    action are in themselves a deterrent against such action.
    outlines the steps taken by the jnul to encourage publishers to
    comply with the law, in order to ensure that as many books as

    chairs, tables and carrels were adjacent and frequently

    arrangement may increase talking and thus noise levels. it was
    hypothesised that disassembling the clusters and separating the
    3 types of furniture would reduce noise. a multiple baseline
    design was used with 2 measures of noise' an electromechanical
    (objective) system and subjective ratings of perceived noise.
    results showed no difference due to the objective measure but

    <text>when the national librarian again spoke his mind.
    comments on the annual report of the danish research library

    palle birkelund, the national librarian. danish research
    libraries are not given the support from the state in the
    economic crisis which they receive in sweden. he expressed
    fears that the proposed library act, far from creating unity
    within the danish library service, would emphasise the division
    between research libraries under the cultural ministry and
    those under the education ministry. he hoped that the cultural
    minister would not be unduly influenced by the danish library
    association when formulating the library act related to
    research libraries. instead of attacking them for lack of
    openness to the public the minister should see that economic
    barriers to their activities are removed.</text>

    or donation by oslo university's norwegian department. it has
    been computer-produced since 1972. norwegian book production
    increased by 105% during 1970-78, while norwegian participation
    in ubc and isds has necessitated the introduction of aacr, isbd
    and isbn. staffing has not been increased proportionately, and
    considerable arrears of uncatalogued material exist. the
    5-yearly cumulation for 1971-75 is at present available in
    machine-readable form only. a microfiche catalogue of norwegian
    publications is produced bi-monthly, with cumulations for
    1971-75 and 1976-78. the university library's national
    bibliography data base is already partly on-line. indexing of
    periodical articles, planned from 1980, will cover 400
    periodicals in most subject fields. newspape r articles cannot
    be covered meanwhile. the 2bibliography of norwegian government

    <text>general performance analysis of key-to-address
    transformation methods using an abstract file concept this
    paper presents a new approach to the analysis of performance of
    the various key-to-address transformation methods. in this
    approach the keys in a file are assumed to have been selected
    from the key space according to a certain probabilistic
    selection algorithm. all files with the same number of keys
    selected from this key space will be suitably weighted in
    accordance with the algorithm, and the average performance of
    the transformation methods on these files will be used as the
    potential of these methods. using this analysis, methods with
    the same overall performance can be classified and key
    distributions partial to certain transformations can be
    identified. all this can be done analytically. the approach is
    applied to a group of transformation methods using files whose
    keys are selected randomly. october, 1973 lum, v. y. hashing,

    <text>user and librarian in conversation, pt. 2. when
    continuing observations were made of readers' advisory work
    carried out by staff in several different libraries, it was
    noted that some cataloguing media are kept for staff use only;
    instruction on the use of others is provided for the public.
    the use of catalogues and reference works for subject and title
    requests was analysed, revealing considerable variations in the
    use of different media by different people. the dictionary
    catalogue was the catalogue type most widely used and some of
    the most popular subject and keyword requests are described.

    <text>qualification of librarians and information scientists.
    having mentioned briefly the importance of libraries to
    society, and also courses offered for prospective non-graduate
    and graduate librarians and information scientists in slovakia,
    discusses continuing education and in-service training of
    library and information centre staff. since 1976, the said
    concept has enjoyed official backing by regulations issued by
    the slovak ministry of culture. the regulations are binding on
    all central and other major libraries. so far, the most
    important training projects have been launched by matica
    slovenska and by the slovak technical library. in-service
    courses should not only include lectures, but also work in
    seminars and smaller groups. visits to selected libraries and
    discussions with their staff stimulate the exchange of views
    and ideas. films and other illustrative materials must be used
    more fully. graduates, continuing their studies abroad, must be
    encouraged to concentrate on topical proble ms, and to aim at
    posts with responsibility. users of library and information
    services have to be educated and trained, too, to make the best
    of the resources available. starting with undergraduates, the
    scheme must be expanded to involve the whole nation in

    1910. it is mainly concerned with further education,
    publishing, information and international cooperation. since
    1978, the state grant to public libraries has been increased to
    68%, making finnish public libraries the largest recipients of
    state aid in scandinavia. the 1978 proposal to transfer library
    services from the school board to the education ministry has
    not yet been implemented. nor has any action been taken on the
    finance ministerial working party's report of 1979 on staffing
    and job distribution in public libraries. a 3 year course for
    library assistants was begun in 1978. the finnish library
    association has pointed out that despite reasonable state
    grants, certain sectors, such as county and mobile libraries,
    are inadequately funded. outlines the association's objectives

    <text>a graph formulation of a school scheduling algorithm the
    problem classically titled "the examination schedule problem"
    takes various forms in the literature. most of these
    formulations can be presented in the terminology of classical
    network theory. one such formulation is: given a nondirected
    network, partition its nodes into a minimal number of subsets
    such that no two members of the same subset are connected by
    anarc. an obvious lower limit to this number is the size of the
    largest strongly connected subgraph. kirchgassner proved that
    an upper limit is this size plus one. one logical extension of
    the previous work is the introduction of variable length
    examinations where w(i) is the number of periods for exam i.
    the object of this paper is to generalize the definition of
    largest strongly connected subgraph to include the weighting of
    nodes, to present an approximate algorithm which usually finds
    the largest strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the
    application of this algorithm to the solution of school
    scheduling and exam scheduling problems. december, 1974

    algorithms. it is based on the observation that in typical uses
    context changes are infrequent relative to retrievals, so that

    auxiliary structures are built up to make the search rapid.

    can succeed. questions the common unthinking acceptance of the

    of the university library. exchanges of publications are
    maintained with 215 institutions in 40 countries. of these
    contacts, those with neighbouring countries are of a special

    <text>the digital simulation of river plankton population
    dynamics this paper deals with the development of a
    mathematical model for and the digital simulation in fortran iv
    of phytoplankton and zooplankton population densities in a
    river using previously developed rate expressions. in order to
    study the relationships between the ecological mechanisms
    involved, the simulation parameters were varied illustrating
    the response of the ecosystem to different conditions,
    including those corresponding to certain types of chemical and
    thermal pollution. as an investigation of the accuracy of the
    simulation methods, a simulation of the actual population
    dynamics of asterionella in the columbia river was made based
    on approximations of conditions in that river. although not
    totally accurate, the simulation was found to predict the
    general annual pattern of plankton growth fairly well and,
    specifically, revealed the importance of the annual velocity
    cycle in determining such patterns. in addition, the study
    demonstrates the usefulness of digital simulations in the
    examinations of certain aquatic ecosystems, as well as in
    environmental planning involving such examinations. september,

    <text>better education in immigrant matters for librarians is
    wanted. traditional library activities for established user
    groups are still the norm in swedish libraries, and immigrant
    services are carried out as humanitarian aid with consequent
    low status. if demand for immigrant literature were treated
    like that for cook books or stamp catalogues a less emotional
    attitude would be achieved. libraries must help immigrants to
    retain their mother tongue as well as to learn swedish. there
    are governmental guidelines on stocking of immigrant literature
    and channels of supply are available, but coordination of
    acquisition and cataloguing is needed. more contact with
    immigrant organisations and better education of librarians are
    necessary. what has already been done is largely due to the

    <text>the minister has been led astray. the contribution by a
    member of the danish library association's executive committee
    to a debate on school libraries held at the danish school
    library association's annual meeting, oct 81. argues that the
    ministry of culture in its library bill has disregarded the
    library commission's proposals for school libraries. although
    research libraries were not included in the 1964 library act, a
    unified library system was brought about with the inclusion of
    school libraries. the ideal of unity is now being set aside.
    but if the school libraries are to be transferred to the
    schools, the minimum demand to ensure their existence must be
    by-laws governing their relationship to public libraries and a
    separate budget. these requirements were confirmed by the
    minister of culture. yet the library bill makes no mention of
    them and reduces the separate budget to an accounting item in
    the local authority finances. the bill is, therefore, totally
    unacceptable to the danish li brary association.</text>

    <text>performance monitoring in a time-sharing system a
    software measurement facility which is part of a general
    purpose time-sharing system is described. the date collection
    facility (dcf) has been implemented in the michigan terminal
    system (mts) for the system/360 model 67. it exists for the
    purpose of monitoring operating system and user program
    behavior and performance. the overall structure of mts is
    outlined in order to explain the implementation of the dcf.
    events in the system are identified and recorded from within
    the supervisor, and dumped to magnetic tape by an auxiliary
    program for off-line processing. events in user programs which
    are unrelated to system actions are recorded with a supervisor
    call. the time of occurrence of each event is accurately
    recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
    type. the overhead associated with data collection and its
    interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed, and both
    are shown to be minimal. several examples are given of
    information obtained with the facility and of applications in
    which it has been useful. some general guidelines are offered
    for the construction of future monitoring programs. november,

    <text>old bookbinding techniques in modern restoration of
    written material, 6' the construction of globes. the first
    globe of the earth was made at the end of the 15th century;
    globes of the heavens were in existence some time earlier.
    methods of globe manufacture from the 18th century onwards are
    described to illustrate the need for constant improvement.
    globe manufacture frequently involves work by a number of
    different craftsmen. a geographer, mathematician or astronomer
    creates the preliminary design, then a carpenter provides a
    basic wooden structure which is covered with paper paste. the
    map must be cut into sections before being fixed onto the globe
    and then a top layer of lime or chalk is added. an alternative
    manufacturing method is to fill a pottery mould with paper
    mache. pocket globes are often made entirely of wood. a globe
    must be light, easily turned but perfectly balanced.</text>

    (ciae) was faced with difficulties in coping with demands from
    external students. the college carried out a survey, sending
    questionnaires to 40 colleges in australia; the results are
    outlined. major conclusions were that services by college
    libraries for external students were varied, and in an
    embryonic stage, and there was urgent need for the development
    of standards for library services to external students. more
    cooperation between the librarian and external studies
    department staff was needed. the conclusions enabled the ciae
    to refine objectives and to expand the concept of the external

    services currently available in japan are jois, tool-ir,

    with literature retrieval services are: (1) data bases do not

    zentralblatter are not available on-line; (3) indexing of

    problems, the nippon medical school library produces index
    cards for special feature articles which are not easily

    <text>problems of cataloguing and classification in theater
    librarianship. problems in cataloguing and classifying theatre
    resources have significantly contributed to the difficulties of
    theatre librarianship. the unsuitability of major existing
    classification systems for use with theatre collections has
    prompted librarians to seek alternatives, such as modifications
    and original classifications. additionally, collections of
    non-book, or 'fugitive', theatrical memorabilia are practically
    impossible to catalogue properly, given the desperate financial
    situation facing many theatre collections. us survey data on
    current practices indicate a strong trend toward
    standardisation of procedures in classifying, yet a continuing
    diversity in cataloguing methods. the coming of computer
    technology, along with increased awareness among theatre
    librarians and input from concerned professional organisations,
    may help alleviate some of these problems in the future.</text>

    <text>art to the people. argues that libraries have an
    important role to play in making the public familiar with art.
    the 1964 danish library act made it possible to develop art
    departments and several larger libraries took advantage of
    this, lending mostly prints, posters and slides. this
    development has now stagnated owing to various misconceptions.
    thus art need not be placed in special buildings only visited
    by highly motivated people. a library should begin by lending
    posters, which are easy to handle, and then proceed to prints.
    art need not be expensive, a poster costing no more than a
    book, and large collections are not necessary. whereas
    acquisition of posters is simple, prints and slides demand more
    attention as central aids to selection of material are lacking.
    exhibitions are important for widening people's conception of
    art. regrets that the new danish library bill omits any mention
    of art.</text>

    <text>on the complexity of lr(k) testing the problem of
    determining whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is a
    member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the
    lr(k) grammars is considered. the time complexity of this
    problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed
    integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test.
    in the first case, it is shown that for every k there exists an
    o(n(k+2)) algorithm for testing the lr(k) property, where n is
    the size of the grammar in question. on the other hand, if both
    k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the
    complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the
    representation chosen for k. more specifically, it is shown
    that this problem is np-complete when k is expressed in unary.
    when k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for
    nondeterministic exponential time. these results carry over to
    many other parameterized classes of grammars, such as the
    ll(k), strong ll(k), slr(k), lc(k), and strong lc(k) grammars.

    <text>the working set model for program behavior probably the
    most basic reason behind the absence of a general treatment of
    resource allocation in modern computer systems is an adequate
    model for program behavior. in this paper a new model, the
    "working set model," is developed. the working set of pages
    associated with a process, defined to be the collection of its
    most recently used pages, provides knowledge vital to the
    dynamic management of paged memories. "process" and "working
    set" are shown to be manifestations of the same ongoing
    computational activity; then "processor demand" and "memory
    demand" are defined; and resource allocation is formulated as
    the problem of balancing demands against available equipment.

    answering similar sets of questions through the use of film and
    fiche versions of the same catalogue. the 1st test employed
    average library users-students and their non-student
    acquaintances. the 2nd test focussed on campus library staff.
    the results suggest that there is very little difference in the

    access to large quantities of data and the opportunity to
    refine the enquiry by conversing with the computer. at present,
    data bases can be used to determine if a translation of a
    document, or an alternative, already exists. they can assist

    <text>a unifying computational method for the analysis of
    complete factorial experiments a computational method which may
    be used for the calculation of sums of squares in the analysis
    of variance of complete factorial experiments and in the
    computation of main effect or interaction means is described.
    the method is elucidated as unifying since one method can be
    used for a variety of purposes each previously requiring
    different methods. the programming advantages of such a method
    are obvious. the following variants are discussed: (1) the
    standard analysis of variance; (2) analyses omitting certain
    levels of one or more factors; (3) separate analyses for some
    levels of a factor or for combinations of levels of more than
    one factor. these are performed simultaneously; (4) the
    calculation of main effect or interaction means. the mean
    expects the data in standard order and it leaves the data in
    that order so that many analyses of the same data can be
    performed without rearrangement. the total sum of squares,
    excluding a replication sum of squares, is partitioned into all
    polynomial partitions and their interactions each with one
    degree of freedom. this is so even if factors have unequally
    spaced factor levels. january, 1967 cooper, b. e. ca670105 jb

    <text>structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves
    using a general waveform parsing system a general waveform
    parsing system with application to structural pattern
    recognition of carotid pulse waves is described. the carotid
    arterial pulse wave is of medical importance because of
    variation in its structure induced by arterial aging and
    cardiovascular disease. the syntax-driven waveform analysis
    system has been applied with good results to these pulse waves
    to detect and measure structural variations. the waveform
    parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compiler system and
    allows the user to enter application specific information as
    data. it is thus general enough to be applicable to other
    waveforms. december, 1976 stockman, g. kanal, l. kyle, m. c.

    <text>job motivation and satisfaction of reference staff in
    public libraries. argues that despite automation, library work
    will remain labour intensive; it is therefore essential to
    consider the human aspect of the situation, particularly in
    reference work, where in general the quality is low. to
    investigate the relation between job motivation and
    satisfaction, a survey was carried out among ontario reference
    library staff, using techniques of analysis and measurement
    adapted from the field of business studies. details are given
    of the methodology, questionnaire construction, and rating
    techniques. results showed generally moderate satisfaction with
    environmental conditions, but low motivation. the initial
    hypothesis, that professionals would express greater motivation
    and satisfaction than non-professionals, was not
    confirmed.</text>

    offers extensive training in book construction, repair,
    restoration and conservation. classes, limited to 8 or 10
    students, begin learning the methods, materials, and techniques
    of book-binding by making a case-bound notebook. practice on
    other books follows, and for the remainder of the 2-week
    course, students sew the bindings. students finish the course

    text of an interview with dick reumer, director of the
    nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum, on the 10th
    anniversary of the founding of the centre. reumer believes that
    the most important problems facing libraries in the netherlands
    in 1982 are the government's decision to reduce subsidies to
    public libraries by 15% and the proposed legislation relating
    to the public services, which will replace the present public
    library act. for the nblc the new legislation will mean the
    decentralisation of library services throughout the regions and
    closer cooperation amongst libraries in the same area. to
    celebrate the 10th anniversary of the nblc a jubilee congress
    is to be held at which the centre's services will come under
    close examination and will be more actively promoted to the
    public.</text>

    <text>storing a sparse table the problem of storing and

    hashing, but hashing has poor worst-case performance. we
    propose a good worst-case method for storing a static table of
    n entries, each an integer between 0 and n - 1. the method
    requires 0(n) w words of storage and allows o(logn n) access
    time. although our method is a little complicated to use in
    practice, our analysis shows why a simpler algorithm used for
    compressing lr parsing tables works so well. november, 1979

    contact with local community leaders is essential. to project a
    dynamic image, services must be manifestly relevant and
    efficient, and geared not only to existing users but also to
    non-users. emphasises that the library's priority is to
    counteract general public apathy by bold initiatives; suggests
    various strategies for drawing public attention, and concludes

    discusses automation in roskilde university library (roskilde
    universitetsbibliotek (rub)). introduction of the
    samkat-project, a joint, computerised cataloguing system for
    research libraries, opens the possibility of coordinating
    accessions and cataloguing, but problems with job distribution
    will be inevitable and should be faced. the standards
    specification group in its preliminary reports on accession
    systems have sketched a system very like the one used at rub.
    when the library was established in 1971 it adopted the
    computerised cataloguing system of denmark's technical library.
    this was developed into an issue and accession system, but not
    without teething troubles. it has nevertheless brought
    advantages, such as transfer of work from routine processes to
    services. the system's output includes' order forms in fiche of
    books on order, budget control which gives accounts by subject,
    reminder lists of books not yet delivered by the bookseller,
    lists of new acquisitions. as printing is excluded on economic
    grounds, problems arise with the constant, tiring use of

    <text>on the downhill method the downhill method is a numerical
    method for solving complex equations f(z) = 0 on which the only
    restriction is that the function w = f(z) must be analytical.
    an introduction to this method is given and a critical review
    of relating literature is presented. although in theory the
    method always converges, it is shown that a fundamental dilemma
    exists which may cause a breakdown in practical applications.
    to avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate of convergence
    toward a root, some modifications of the original method are
    proposed and a program (fortran) based on the modified method
    is given in algorithm 365. some numerical examples are
    included. december, 1969 bach, h. downhill method, complex

    netherlands was founded in 1908. from the foundation of the
    institute funds were provided by the university for the
    creation of a central geographical library and by 1969 the
    library had grown to such an extent that the book and map
    collections were physically separated. by 1978 the map
    collection contained 65,000 maps, 900 atlases, 8 globes and
    some 12,000 serial photos. approximately 2,000 maps and 50
    atlases are acquired annually, of which 45% are received by
    purchase, 50% by donation and 5% by exchange. the map room is
    open to the general public for consultation and deals with some
    1,500 readers annually.</text>

    <text>convert a programming language is described which is
    applicable to problems conveniently described by transformation
    rules. by this is meant that patterns may be prescribed, each
    being associated with a skeleton, so that a series of such
    pairs may be searched until a pattern is found which matches an
    expression to be transformed. the conditions for a match are
    governed by a code which also allows subexpressions to be
    identified and eventually substituted into the corresponding
    skeleton. the primitive patterns and primitive skeletons are
    described, as well as the principle which allow their
    elaboration in to more complicated patterns and skeletons. the
    advantages of the language are that it allows one to apply
    transformation rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings,
    that both patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively,
    and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite
    concisely. august, 1966 guzman, a. mcintosh, h. v. ca660808 jb

    public access catalogue with a touch sensitive terminal, opened
    in oct 80, was facilitated. the card catalogue is, however,
    being maintained, as the input of subject data is not yet
    complete and as a safeguard against computer break-downs. the
    extra costs involved had not been foreseen, and savings on
    staff are not yet possible. it is, therefore, difficult to
    calculate the long-term savings from automation. the

    then tried the managerial rating model, whereby managers meet

    time to rate their levels of accomplishment. a trial indicated
    that this model was suitable and the committee reported
    accordingly, but no full trial ever took place and the

    <text>an overview of the ispl computer system design this paper
    explores the advantages of the concurrent design of the
    language, operating system, and machine (via microcode) to
    create an interactive programming laboratory. it describes the
    synergistic effect that the freedom to move and alter features
    from one of these domains to another has had on the design of
    this system (which has not been implemented). this freedom
    simplified both incremental compilation and the system's
    addressing structure, and centralized the communication
    mechanisms enabling the construction of hierarchical
    subsystems. it also suggested an important new concept for
    operating systems: separation of the scheduling from the
    maintenance functions in resource allocation. this separation
    enables incorporation of new scheduling algorithms (decision of
    what to do) without endangering the system integration
    (correctly performing the scheduling decisions). february, 1973

    <text>essen workshop 1981' training readers in the use of
    audio-visual media, 1-3 april 1981. lectures were given on
    training readers in the use of audio-visual material at home
    and abroad. forms of training can be very varied; the choice of
    media used depends on the reader's previous knowledge and
    experience and on economic and institutional conditions. at the
    chalmers university of technology, goteborg, the library
    provides a basic introduction for 1st time users, a 14 hour
    course on library search techniques and an advanced course on
    information retrieval. the emphasis should be on 'learning by
    doing'. the collection and information centre for audio-visual
    media planned by the british library was described and a
    discussion was held on the merits and demerits of different
    media. more cooperation is required between media producers and

    (+s+e+e 82/573). the publishing of the library for talking
    books and braille (tpb) is very important for the supply of
    talking books. 1200 titles annually are produced for loan in
    libraries, of which the tpb accounts for 900. the selection of
    books includes all easy readers and 25% of production are books
    for children and young people. the aged form the largest user
    group. braille books are now in a minority; they are lent
    directly to readers. catalogues of the tpb's stock and new
    acquisitions are being prepared using the bums data base. some
    books for immigrants are available. as a loan centre the tpb is
    obliged to lend to different institutions and collate
    information on local library stocks. it aims to develop the
    decentralisation of talking book provision and therefore wishes
    to transfer to the local public library the responsibility for
    direct lending to individuals and purchase of an adequate stock
    from the library service.</text>

    <text>economies that affect the heart of the service' a 2buch

    of discussion between friedrich andrae, klaus hohlfeld, ulrich
    thiem, hans joachim vogt and 2buch und bibliothek1 held at the
    german library association's annual conference in bremen, nov
    81. it is a librarian's job to promote the use of books, a job
    which must be taken more seriously than ever before. recent
    surveys have shown that about 40% of the population are library
    users. where possible, economies should be made in working
    methods rather than in services; this demands more
    centralisation. it is better to put books in laundry baskets on
    window ledges and on pavements than to take them away from the
    public completely or to make them available only for restricted
    periods. libraries make a valuable contribution towards the
    mastery of life's problems, an argument which politicians and
    administrators are beginning to appreciate.</text>

    absence of financial support, gin is likely to remain a paper
    agreement. even if it were established, it would do little to
    fulfil the real science information needs of the third world. a
    better alternative for developing countries would be to share

    1953, moved into new buildings, while 2 other buildings were
    erected for libraries in higher education. in spite of these
    improvements, there is still a considerable shortage of space
    in libraries, which, in general, are also in need of
    modernisation. reprographic equipment, computer application and
    communication technology must not only ensure better lending
    services, including interlending, but also comprehensive
    information resources as well as a wider dissemination of
    information. like other countries, mobile libraries should
    cater for hamlets and small communities of some 1,000
    inhabitants, and also for urban populations living on new
    housing estates and/or in other areas temporarily without
    libraries. purpose-built buildings should be envisaged for e
    very library with 70,000 and more volumes. depository
    libraries, both on a national and regional level, should also
    be planned to store valuable books and rarely requested
    books.</text>

    <text>a note on storage fragmentation and program segmentation
    the main purpose of this paper is the presentation of some of
    the results of a series of simulation experiments investigating
    the phenomenon of storage fragmentation. two different types of
    storage fragmentation are distinguished: (1) external
    fragmentation, namely the loss in storage utilization caused by
    the inability to make use of all available storage after it has
    been fragmented into a large number of separate blocks; and (2)
    internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization caused by
    rounding up a request for storage, rather than allocating only
    the exact number of words required. the most striking result is
    the apparently general rule that rounding up requests for
    storage, to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks
    coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage by increased
    internal fragmentation than is saved by decreased external
    fragmentation. described also are a method of segment
    allocation and an accompanying technique for segment addressing
    which take advantage of the above result. evidence is presented
    of possible advantages of the method over conventional paging
    techniques. july, 1969 randell, b. storage allocation, storage

    <text>the architect's view of multi-purpose plans. using

    is a natural and good consequence of their developing liaison
    with other cultural activities. the tradition of charging at
    most a nominal rent is less defensible. extra use involves
    upkeep and staffing costs, and organisations may rent
    unsuitable premises for financial reasons. the district centre
    at lyngen, norway, housing a wide range of organisations and a
    potential example of integrated activity, has to charge a rent
    unacceptable to smaller groups. for effective use, all cultural
    premises should have the same financial standing and joint
    administration. in planning or conversion, the needs of
    individual users should be analysed and coordinated. the
    librarian, for instance, should be able to rent certain areas
    full-time (e.g. the necessary space for storing equipment,
    shelving and books) and other areas for the library's actual
    opening hours, outside which they could be used by other

    <text>iranian library of medicine local computer network. in
    order to improve the status of biomedical communications in
    iran, the iranian library of medicine (ilm) embarked on a long
    term plan which also included computerisation of certain
    functions of the library. implementation of this plan started
    by establishing an access node to the national library of
    medicine's (nlm) medline data base, and was followed by the
    setting up of a computer-communications network to provide
    local services, to allow several organisations to have
    simultaneous access to the nlm's data bases, and to cater for
    accessing other data bases available through us-based
    international computer networks. this paper considers the
    circumstances governing the design of the network, reports the
    progress so far achieved in the implementation of the plan, and
    describes major difficulties encountered. the resulting
    increase in the use of the services provided is also noted by
    presenting general statistics of medline use in the regi

    and contribution. identifies present research directions in
    videotex services, including research concerned with hardware
    and software, access to information, social and behavioural
    implications, and methodological and regulatory matters. the
    canadian telidon videotex system is generally perceived as a
    high-quality alternative to the uk serial alpha-mosaic and
    french parallel alpha-mosaic coding systems. intrinsic
    differences in the conceptual design of telidon have created a
    quite different communication medium. new directions for
    research and development (based upon a communication protocol
    independent of display, carrier, and content and capable of
    responding to a variable scale cost/quality continuum) provide
    opportunities for development significant to both public and
    private sectors of the economy.</text>

    <text>efficient implementation of a variable projection
    algorithm for nonlinear least squares problems nonlinear least
    squares frequently arise for which the variables to be solved
    for can be separated into a linear and a nonlinear part. a
    variable projection algorithm has been developed recently which
    is designed to take advantage of the structure of a problem
    whose variables separate in this way. this paper gives a
    slightly more efficient and slightly more general version of
    this algorithm than has appeared earlier. march, 1974 krogh, f.

    <text>revising the dewey music schedules' tradition vs.

    schedules of the dewey decimal classification and the library
    association's proposal for a total revision of these schedules.
    the analysis is based on the ability of each classification to
    serve the needs of library patrons using the shelf arrangement
    to retrieve scores for performance purposes. the basis of the
    comparison presented here is a random sample of 400
    chamber-music scores chosen from the 2british catalogue of
    music1. each classification is analysed for its strengths and
    weaknesses in terms of its ability to meet the needs of
    performers, and the classifications are then compared using
    standard statistical methods. concludes with a discussion of
    whether or not the library association's proposal is a proper
    vehicle for a phoenix treatment of ddc 780 and some of the
    consequences of including it in some future edition of

    registered users will be able to enter the system by telephone.
    a colour television screen as a display device and an
    instrument with a digital keyboard will also be necessary.
    information providers will need a keyboard similar to that of a
    typewriter with some additional characters to obtain graphics.
    at present the system is mainly oriented to users with digital
    keyboards which means that all information has to be made
    available through numerical identification. facility selection
    is made through an index process prepared by the user. the
    procedure could be speeded up by creating a users' catalogue
    such as prestel provides. if btx storage facilities are
    expanded and the speed of access is improved it should provide
    additional possibilities for connecting general and t echnical
    information systems. care should be taken to integrate this new

    atlases in bulgaria. covers only maps issued up to 1944, in
    which bulgaria is included. the oldest of them are not very
    elaborate, with text in latin only. from the 16th century,
    parallel text in german and/or french was added. up to the 18th
    century, the maps were printed and published mainly in
    amsterdam, rome, ausburg and nuerburg, bulgaria's own
    cartographic facilities started with the first map produced by
    a bulgarian in bulgarian which was published in 1843. even
    then, however, maps were printed in vienna. another step
    forward was the liberation from turkish rule (1878), followed
    by the foundation of various national institutions, headed by
    the state national geographical institute (1891) and the
    university of sofia (1898) with the chair of geography . there
    were also historic maps published from 1878 to 1944. among
    them, the most important is the map of uprising and class
    struggle, aiming towards and eventually leading to the

    <text>john harris' nz's gift to nigerian library education. new
    zealander john harris (1903-80) arrived in nigeria in 1948 to
    be librarian of the fledgeling university college, ibadan. he
    almost single-handedly created nigeria's premier academic press
    and, with his wife, its 1st university bookshop. he played a
    major role in forming the west african library association and
    initiated the 1st formal library education course in nigeria.
    thanks largely to him, the 1st library school in nigeria, the
    institute of librarianship, was established in 1959 with a
    grant from the carnegie corporation-this in the face of
    competition from other west african states wishing to establish

    <text>another look at oclc's potential for special libraries.
    the issue of oclc benefits for special libraries is discussed
    in terms of 'find rates'. a stratified random sample revealed
    that 21% of a special collection's holdings were in the oclc
    data base and were scattered among 95 libraries. this low find
    rate is useful for documenting the uniqueness of the special
    collection and the lack of existing bibliographical control for
    such material. the study suggests that special libraries
    consider oclc participation when find rates are low based on
    considerations other than cost savings for technical
    services.</text>

    <text>a record and file partitioning model one of the main
    objectives in the design of a file system is the reduction of
    storage and data transfer costs. this paper presents a model in
    which several requests access the file system, and each request
    requires information from one or more variable length
    data-items. the probabilities of access and the distribution of
    each data-item's length are assumed to be known, and to be
    mutually independent. the file system uses one or more storage
    devices, and each record may be partitioned into subrecords
    that are stored on different devices. one of the subrecords is
    designated as the primary record; when a request for a record
    is made, the primary record is first accessed, and other
    subrecords are accessed only if the pertinent information is
    not stored in the primary record. the model that is presented
    in this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and a
    mixed integer programming model, is a very general one; several
    types of file systems may be derived from it by an appropriate
    selection of its parameters. this model has already been used
    in the optimization of library routines' storage at a large
    scale operating system. january, 1977 babad, j. m. file system,

    <text>a simscript-fortran case study two programs for a vehicle

    in 7040 fortran iv are compared. the comparison is made in
    terms of basic program design decisions, storage requirements,
    computer time used, and the ease of making changes. in the
    simscript program, the primary design considerations center
    around the choice of model variables, model changing events,
    and model testing. in the fortran program, basic design
    problems relate to the representation of the passage of time,
    the allocation of storage, and the organization of input data.
    the comparison of these differently designed programs shows
    that the simscript program uses more computer storage and more
    computer time, but requires fewer program changes to introduce

    and research libraries and interlending services. would prefer
    school libraries to belong under the education ministry, but
    they should cater for leisure reading as well as providing
    educational resource material. librarians should be left to
    fulfil the obligation of comprehensiveness in book selection,
    and local politicians should not exercise any form of
    censorship prior to selection. stands firm on the principle of
    no charge for any library services. librar ies cannot be immune

    <text>nebula: a digital computer using a 20 mc glass delay line
    memory oregon state university has designed and constructed a
    medium-speed serial digital computer using glass delay lines
    circulating at 22 mc as memory. the design objectives as
    originally conceived in a special seminar were: (1) to be a
    research project in computer design; (2) to be usable as an
    educational machine;and (3) to have easily modifiable hardware
    for basic research in computer systems design. an unusual
    arrangement of information within the 22 mc memory allows a
    simple interface with the 340 kc arithmetic unit, which results
    in an effective zero latency time and provides possibilities
    for an associative memory. the arithmetic unit has a command
    structure similar to large parallel machines, and uses
    flip-flop arithmetic and control registers throughout. all
    hardware development has been aimed toward the concept of easy
    modification, elaborate console controls for effective
    man-machine interaction and low cost. july, 1966 boles, j. a.

    <text>occurrences of cycling and other phenomena arising in a
    class of linear programming models an investigation into the
    average queue size for a certain class of queues has resulted
    in the formulation of linear programming problems which are
    ill-conditioned in some cases. in attempting to solve these
    linear programming models, using ibm's mps package, instances
    of cycling were encountered. small perturbations in the input
    data resulted in problems which did not cycle. this fact, plus
    several other observed phenomena suggest that the primary
    reason that cycling is not known to occur more frequently is
    the round-off errors in the computations perturb the problem
    sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at least to prevent
    indefinite cycling). in one case maximizing and minimizing an
    objective function subject to the same constrain t set was
    attempted, but mps solved only one of these while giving an
    indication of infeasibility for the other. february, 1977

    <text>reduction of a band-symmetric generalized eigenvalue
    problem an algorithm is described for reducing the generalized
    eigenvalue problem ax = lambda bx to an ordinary problem, in
    case a and b are symmetric band matrices with b positive
    definite. if n is the order of the matrix and m the bandwidth,
    the matrices a and b are partitioned into m-by-m blocks; and
    the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks. the
    algorithm reduces the generalized problem to an ordinary
    eigenvalue problem for a symmetric band matrix c whose
    bandwidth is the same as a and b. the algorithm is similar to
    those of rutishauser and schwartz for the reduction of
    symmetric matrices to band form. the calculation c requires
    order mn^2 operation. the round-off error in the calculation of
    c is of the same order as the sum of the errors at each of the
    n/m steps of the algorithm, the latter errors being largely
    determined by the condition of b with respect to inversion.

    <text>on accurate floating-point summation the accumulation of
    floating-point sums is considered on a computer which performs
    t-digit base b floating-point addition with exponents in the
    range -m to m. an algorithm is given for accurately summing n
    t-digit floating-point numbers. each of these n numbers is
    split into q parts, forming qn t-digit floating-point numbers.
    each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n
    auxiliary t-digit accumulators. finally, the accumulators are
    added together to yield the computed sum. in all, qn+n-1
    t-digit floating-point additions are performed. under usual
    conditions, the relative error in the computed sum is at most
    [(t+1)/v]b^(1-t) for some v. further, with an additional q+n-1
    t-digit additions, the computed sum can be corrected to full
    t-digit accuracy. for example, for the ibm/360 (b=16, t=14,
    m=63, m=64), typical values for q and n are q=2 and n=32. in
    this case, (*) becomes n &lt;= 32,768, and we have

    <text>a fast and usually linear algorithm for global flow
    analysis (abstract only--complete paper jacm 23,1 january,
    1976) a new algorithm for global flow analysis on reducible
    graphs is presented. the algorithm is shown to treat a very
    general class of function spaces. for a graph of e edges, the
    algorithm has a worst case time bound of o(e log e) function
    operations. it is also shown that in programming terms, the
    number of operations is proportional to e plus the number of
    exits from program loops. consequently a restriction to
    one-entry one-exit control structures linearity. the algorithm
    can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and
    graphs by relaxing the time bound. examples are given of code
    improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.

    decisions and recommendations of the unesco uap conference to
    be held in 1981-82. this convention should declare the

    <text>a view from zambia. contribution to a section devoted to

    zambia, acquisitions are centralised, which can lead to
    unsuitable selection for local libraries. the national library
    receives most funds, while other libraries suffer, and there
    are few good bookshops. interlending is focused on the national
    university library, and attempts to create a national union
    catalogue have failed so far. demand for books is high, but
    librarians' status is low. interlending could be based on
    existing research collections, but a central collection of

    <text>the struggle for full implementation of the public
    libraries law-1975 (in hebrew). when the law was passed, it was
    generally understood that the government would finance 75% of
    public library budgets. the situation over the past several
    years has been that an ever-growing percentage of the budget is
    covered by local authorities. this has not only brought about a
    deterioration of public library services, but may lead to a
    situation in which the libraries section of the ministry of
    education and culture will be unable to enforce the high
    standards it has set, since it will not have the necessary
    funds to pass on to local authorities. documents the actions
    and efforts of the committee on the full implementation of the
    public libraries law since its formation in june 78. these
    include correspondence and meetings with senior government and
    parliamentary officials and a public effort to achieve
    implementation, the height of which was a national librarians'
    demonstration before the ministry of e ducation and culture in
    jerusalem in jan 80.</text>

    <text>technology and the information professional: will it make
    a difference?. examines the likely impact of new technology on
    librarians and information scientists, and on data base
    producers, over the next 10 years. data base producers will
    increasingly rely on home-based abstractors who receive, create
    and send all their material by electronic means. the advantages
    of such procedures for the data base producers are outlined.
    increasing use of videodiscs for information storage and
    retrieval is envisaged. the impact of new technology on
    librarians and information scientists is then examined. use of
    videodiscs will mean a decline in the use of on-line
    information retrieval. use of intelligent terminals will lead
    to greater use of these systems by end-users. the intelligent
    terminals could be used to translate software languages, to
    refine search strategies, to store and edit output from
    searches and to advise users on the best data bases and best
    search strategy to use. all these developments will be
    integrated into those leading to the 'office of the future'.
    concludes that there will be a dramatic shakeout in
    librarianship, but that information scientists face a great
    opportunity to develop their skills by the opportunities
    afforded by the new technology. it is recommended that schools
    of information science teach their students typing skills.
    finally, some remarks about the advisability of offering
    sophisticated information retrieval systems to less developed
    countries are made.</text>

    cassettes are an excellent complement to music literature and
    can stimulate people to read books about music. cassettes for
    children may encourage children to read who are not yet keen
    readers; good quality cassettes must be selected since there is
    a wide range on the market in this field. language cassettes
    should be arranged on bookshelves with their accompanying
    textbooks. literature cassettes are useful for readers with
    poor sight, so they should be placed near the large print
    books; they are also helpful for people with reading
    difficulties and for group listening and discussion.</text>

    <text>is such an investigation worthy of kl?. comments on the
    report of the national association of local authorities
    (kommunernes landsforening (kl)) on the trial run of the public
    libraries' automation system, faust, in olstykke library. gives
    the reasons for the failure of faust as lack of perceived
    economic returns, opposition of the librarians' union on the
    grounds of staff reductions, and size of initial investments.
    the few librarians who pointed to improved service and
    long-term economic benefits were overruled. biblioteksdata,
    which replaced faust in 1978, is more decentralised, with
    services tailor-made to individual libraries' needs. argues
    that kl in its report dismisses the value of the trial run and
    the staff's views of the experiment, which stress the
    labour-saving effects of the automated issue control system.
    calls for central registration of public libraries' stock in
    the common data base by the library centre; then the individual
    library can begin registration of its own sto ck and start
    using automated issue control with ensuing improvements in
    service and labour economies.</text>

    1969 and 71, which give a good description and numerous
    practical examples. special materials briefly discussed are
    sheet music and records, patents and standards, graphics and
    audiovisuals, archive material and documents. rational approach
    to work with special documents includes group cataloguing and
    machine processing, especially of technical material.
    methodological centres should extablish which materials cause
    libraries the most problems and devise ways of solving

    the netherlands have undertaken no studies of the social
    implications on their members' behalf apart from the
    netherlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for
    libraries and literature), which in 1979 formed a committee to
    investigate ways of protecting the privacy of the individual
    against the misuse of personal information in computerised
    systems. however, the recommendations of the committee were
    rejected in 1980 by nblc members as too radical. automation
    will lead to a reduction in the number of posts in libraries at

    <text>achieving specific accuracy in simulation output analysis
    this paper extends the use of the regenerative property of
    queueing systems in the analysis of simulation output. in
    particular, it describes a sequential estimation method which
    when used with the regenerative property allows results to be
    obtained with specified statistical accuracy. this method
    includes a test to check the normality assumption on which the
    sequential procedure relies. the paper illustrates the method
    using the empty and idle state as the regenerative state. a
    second example then describes how using the most frequently
    entered state as the regenerative state reduces the chance of
    making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run. the
    paper also described how a variance reduction method due to
    page [9] can be used to obtain a specified accuracy with
    considerably fewer job completions than are required when no
    variance reduction technique is applied. may, 1977 fishman, g.

    <text>a general formulation of storage allocation formalization
    of a general computer storage allocation process is attempted.
    with a given computer m is associated a fictitious computer m'
    essentially identical to m except in respect to possession of
    unbounded primary storage. mappings of the total storage set
    (internal and external) of m into the direct address set of m'
    are introduced. a program sequence p for m' is termed
    m-admissible (relative to a specific execution time period) if
    there is a mapping underwhich p and its effective data
    referents are all located in the direct address set of m.
    storage allocation is considered as a process of establishing
    for an arbitrary m' program a sequence of mappings, a
    decoupling of the program into m-admissible subprograms and a
    linking set of interludes. an existence proof in terms of a
    completely interpretive m program as indicated. some special
    cases are discussed. various restrictions on generality of m'
    programs are considered under which more practical realization
    of allocation processes becomes tractable. october, 1961

    <text>perfect hashing functions: a single probe retrieving
    method for static sets a refinement of hashing which allows
    retrieval of an item in a static table with a single probe is
    considered. given a set i of identifiers, two methods are
    presented for building, in a mechanical way, perfect hashing
    functions, i.e. functions transforming the elements of i into
    unique addresses. the first method, the "quotient reduction"
    method, is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set
    i the smallest table in which the elements of i can be stored
    and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing
    function constructed by this method can be found. however, for
    nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather
    sparse tables. the second method, the "remainder reduction"
    method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems to
    give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set.
    the two techniques are applicable directly to small sets. some
    methods to extend these results to larger sets are also
    presented. a rough comparison with ordinary hashing is given
    which shows that this method can be used conveniently in
    several practical applications. november, 1977 sprugnoli, r.

    performing global query optimization, (2) exploiting disjoint
    and pipelined concurrency, (3) coordinating sort orders in
    temporary relations, (4) employing directory analysis, and (5)
    maintaining locality in page references. algorithms for
    implementing the operators of e. f. codd's relational algebra
    are presented, and a methodology for composing them to optimize
    the performance of a particular user query is described.

    <text>a general business-oriented language based on decision
    expressions* the structure of a digital compute programming
    language which covers a wide class of business and file
    processing applications is presented. such a structure, based
    on identifying and incorporating into a compiler the aspects
    common to all processes of such class, permits writing
    extremely compact programs, even for comparatively complex
    applications, in terms of tables of control expressions which
    express only information characteristic of the particular
    application. furthermore,local changes of a process (e.g.
    changes affecting only one of the output files involved) can be
    effected by local modifications in the program (e.g.
    modification of only one entry of the tables). this structure
    also allows for inexpensive preparation of loading-speed
    compilers which translate the source programs into efficient
    machine codes. the approach adopted here departs from
    conventional mechanical language design philosophies. it
    stresses the structural analysis of the class of processes to
    be represented in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing
    formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions. it
    relies exclusively on nonprocedural representation of process
    as sets (tables) of relations between data and results (there
    are no control statements such as go to, etc.), instead of
    using procedure descriptions (which are one-to-one translations
    of flowcharts). here an invariant pattern of procedure is
    identified as characteristic of the class of all batch file
    processes. this new philosophy has the potential to overcome
    well-known deficiencies of other business-oriented languages
    and fully meets the requirements set by codasyl for such
    languages, including machine-independence. february, 1964

    stickers to be placed over portions of her book found
    objectionable by a school administration and a successful
    writer's agreeing to expurgate portions of his novel to cut

    teachers, and school administrators on the other. examples from
    each link in the chain are illustrated with excerpts from the

    <text>a planned decentralized solution for national document

    document supply is decentralised in west germany because the
    political framework is federal. coordination of acquisitions is
    achieved by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft, which
    organises and largely funds a cooperative programme based on
    special subject libraries (sondersammelgebietsbibliotheken).
    the 7 regional union catalogues have been supplemented by
    central subject catalogues, the berlin periodicals data base,
    and other union cataloguing projects. interlending is based on
    the 7 regions, but direct requesting to the special subject

    <text>design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for
    pl/i pl/c is a compiler for a dialect for pl/i. the design
    objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic
    assistance in a batch processing environment. for the most part
    this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by
    the compiler. the most remarkable characteristic of pl/c is its
    perseverance-it completes translation of every program
    submitted and continues execution until a user-established
    error limit is reached. this requires that the compiler repair
    errors encountered during both translation and execution, and
    the design of pl/c is dominated by this consideration. pl/c
    also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for
    program testing. to accommodate these extensions to pl/i
    without abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler pl/c permits
    "pseudo comments"-constructions whose contents can optionally
    be considered either source test or comment. in spite of the
    diagnostic effort pl/c is a fast and efficient processor. it
    effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better
    diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a
    sophisticated source language is employed, and that this
    assistance need not be prohibitively costly. march, 1973

    <text>an interpretive input routine for linear programming in
    this descriptive article an input code is presented which
    greatly simplifies data input to any linear programming
    solution routine, for subsequent use either as a pedagogical
    device or for solving rather small lp problems. this latter
    (limited) use derives not at all from inherent limitations in
    the code itself, but from an efficiency evaluation: large lp
    problems would doubtless benefit from an input system more
    suited for bulk data handling than the input code described.
    from a user's standpoint, input appears almost exactly as a
    textbook presentation of the lp problem (limited only by a
    keypunch's inability to write subscripts, etc.). the input
    interpreter scans column wise, thus no fixed format data
    preparation is required. the user may also, under very general
    requirements only, liberally use editorial comments throughout
    the input deck as an aid in identification, e.g., of row
    constraints. the article includes examples of input, output
    from a solution routine presently in use, and a skeleton
    flowchart of the input interpreter. january, 1967 aigner, d. j.

    extends the capabilities of this organization to include
    general graphics. two fundamentally different scan conversion
    algorithms which have been developed to support this display
    are presented. one is most suitable to non-interactive
    applications and the other to interactive applications. the
    algorithms were implemented in fortran on the cdc 6400
    computer. results obtained from the implementations show that
    the noninteractive algorithms can significantly reduce display
    file storage requirements at little cost in execution time over
    that of a conventional raster display. the interactive
    algorithm can improve response time and reduce storage
    requirements. march, 1974 barrett, r. c. fordan, b. w. jr.

    video entrepreneurs who have invested millions in the new
    format and nothing in the concept of equal access to all
    information. the new video technologies do have great
    potential, but it is not financially realisable or practicable
    for libraries. libraries must maintain their high standards and

    <text>academic librarians in colleges of further and higher
    education. argues that, as a generalisation, librarians who
    regard themselves as acting within an educational environment
    behave rather differently from those who stress their
    librarianship functions and that these differences are related
    to academic status. the award of academic status encourages the
    former by attracting and retaining those willing to adopt an
    extended educational role. academic rank also elicits the
    internalisation, or self-ascription, by the librarian of
    educational roles.</text>

    <text>hierarchical storage in information retrieval a
    probabilistic analysis is employed to determine the effect of
    hierarchical storage organizations on information retrieval
    operations. the data storage hardware is assumed to consist on
    n-levels of linearly connected memory hardware with increasing
    data access times and increasing data storage capabilities. a
    system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductor
    memory, computer core memory, extended core storage, disk
    memory, and data cells. equations are derived to predict the
    effect of such a system on data access times using sequential
    files, random access files, and structured files employing
    multiple-hierarchical linked lists. may, 1973 salasin, j.

    information network is a network of local agencies linked by a
    pabx telephone. it is very informal, has no constitution, and
    simply aims at providing a better community information service
    than the agencies could if working independently. each agency
    specialises in a particular field. agency representatives meet
    monthly. residents gain access to the network by contacting
    their nearest agency. successes to date include establishment
    of a neighbourhood bus, an accommodation information exchange,
    and a self-help employment service. failures include outreach

    responses from the machine. the feasibility of implementing
    such a system with a fortran-like algebraic compiler as the
    object processor is considered. details of a specific word
    recognition program are given. this technique depends on three
    simplifying restrictions, namely, a "small" vocabulary set,
    "known" speakers, and a "moment of silence" between each input
    word. experimental results are presented giving error rates for
    different experimental conditions as well as the machine
    resources required to accommodate several users at a time. the
    results show that at this time it is both economically and
    logically feasible to handle at least 40 users at a time with

    <text>canonical structure in attribute based file organization
    a new file structure for attribute based retrieval is proposed
    in this paper. it allows queries involving arbitrary boolean
    functions of the attribute-value pairs to be processed without
    taking intersections of lists. the structure is highly
    dependent on the way in which the file is to be used and is
    uniquely determined by the specification of the allowed
    queries. thus, for example, the structure for retrieval on the

    <text>final report of the precis/translingual project. the
    feasibility of providing precis with extra facilities to enable
    it to function as a system for switching indexing data between
    2 or more natural languages was investigated. lexicons were
    established in 3 languages, and a 'pivot file' created to link
    them. routines for switching indexing terms out of a given
    source language and into a chosen target language were devised
    and set down in the form of flow-charts or algorithms. using
    these algorithms, precis strings were switched mainly between
    english, french, and german. problems of translation were
    solved by the use of 'lexical blocks' and the adoption of a
    system of categories. mechanisms for the automatic provision of
    articles in french and german strings were designed. 2 methods
    of providing inflected forms of nouns by algorithm were tested
    in german and polish. the use of 'substitute' phrases in precis
    was investigated, and procedures for the automatic provision
    and construction of phrases in a target language were devised.
    algorithms designed to build prepositional or adjectival
    phrases were tested on english, french, and german precis
    strings.</text>

    <text>ideological bias and books for children and adolescents

    children's books by brazilian authors were examined, and found
    to be composed according to a rigid predetermined structure
    based on a clear and absolute demarcation of good and evil,
    backed by an ideology legitimising the power of adults over
    children. draws a parallel with the subliterature of 19th
    century france, and postulates that brazilian children's
    literature is fundamentally a product of the prevailing social
    and economic order, reflecting in the depiction of the
    parent-child relationship the producer-consumer relationship of
    industrial society. the introduction of superficially
    contemporary material in language and physical detail does not
    affect the essentially reactionary character of such works, and

    at all, so they remain illiterate. many parents are also
    illiterate so reading in leisure hours is not encouraged. what
    school books and lessons there are exist only in an official
    language, generally that of a colonising power. there is a lack
    of published material in local languages, some of which have
    never even been written down. in these countries a library

    <text>the structure of programming languages the following are
    identified as major components of every programming language:
    (1) the elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for
    linking elementary statements together, (3) the means by which
    a program can obtain data inputs. several alternative forms of
    each of these components are described, compared and evaluated.
    many examples, frequently from list processing languages,
    illustrate the forms described. elementary program statements
    usually take the form of commands, requirements, or implicit
    specifications. a command is an imperative statement that
    commands the action to be taken. a requirement describes the
    effect to be achieved without saying anything about the actions
    to be taken. an implicit specification is similar to a
    requirement, but the programmer must understand what actions
    will be taken to achieve the desired effect. subroutines may be
    entered explicitly, by execute call, or by function
    composition. explicitly called subroutines generally require
    special linkage conventions. an execute subroutine call is
    syntactically indistinguishable from a basic instruction of the
    programming language. function composition is a convenient
    alternative to the explicit call. the three principal ways of
    getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to the data
    itself, (2) by referring to the data by a "name", and (3) by
    referring to it implicitly by means of variables or functions.
    names are useful entry points into permanent data structures,
    but can be error-causing distractions in other contexts. the
    author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors
    influencing the choice of a form of component for a language.
    he concludes by suggesting the evolution of programming
    languages toward one which will permit all the most convenient
    ways of structuring programs, organizing systems, and
    referencing data. march, 1966 raphael, b. ca660302 jb march 3,

    are removed not just to better living conditions, but also to a
    full cultural life for the handicapped. the demand for
    information on material for the handicapped available in
    libraries was shown in a campaign led by kalmar regional
    library to be growing among teachers trying to integrate the
    handicapped in schools. staff within the social institutions
    can also act as links between the handicapped and the library.
    the regional library must stimulate local libraries to initiate
    domiciliary services and establish systems for lending of
    speaking books and personal contacts with users. the mass media

    <text>do librarians fear professionalism?. paper presented at
    the national librarians association-sponsored programme at the
    michigan library association, 11 oct 80. argues that in the usa
    librarians have been unable to achieve the distinctive status
    of a profession. they have no way of making the claim stick
    that they have crucial skills and knowledge of vital importance
    to society. as a result they are an occupational group unable
    to increase significantly the economic well being and prestige
    of librarianship through traditional professional means.
    because of library associations' emphasis on the institution,
    there is a lack of concentration on what constitutes the
    professional basis for librarianship; the associations have
    created a situation where the librarian has occupational power
    without the growing social problems of professional

    heating this heating is greatest between heights of and km it
    appears that the heating only becomes important during magnetic
    storms it may explain the lifting of the f region and the
    decrease in critical frequency during these periods
    hydromagnetic heating cannot however explain the variations in
    the horizontal component of the earths field during the main
    phase of magnetic storms</text>

    <text>book reviews in government periodicals. 153 periodicals
    published by the us government and indexed in the 2index to
    u.s. government periodicals 1were searched for book reviews. 20
    carry book reviews regularly (these are listed with comments
    and information on frequency and su/doc number); 81 contain
    lists of their own departmental publications, other government
    printing office material, or extensive bibliographical
    references in connection with their articles; and a total of 84
    carry at least one of the preceding categories (the titles are
    listed). concludes that a great deal of useful information can
    be obtained from government journals-librarians involved in
    collection development must not overlook them.</text>

    <text>scientific and technical libraries and interlending
    schemes. scientific and technical libraries are leaders in the
    field of interlibrary lending in bulgaria. a survey carried out
    in 53 scientific and technical libraries in the period 1977-79
    showed an increase in interlending partners, ranging on average
    from 6-9, but some libraries maintaining contacts with 14, 20,
    or even 27 counterparts. international interlending was
    slightly under 10%, and interlending from central regional
    libraries only 5%. the greatest demand was for periodicals,
    catalogues and patents, followed by books and translations.
    during the survey, librarians put forward many useful
    suggestions for improvement, directed most frequently at the
    central technical library and/or at the cyril and methodius

    accredited by the ala are located in northeastern ohio, merely
    35 miles apart. the study includes a needs assessment, a
    resources assessment, and an analysis of 4 alternative
    approaches-a new programme model, a programme transfer model,
    an extension model, and a consortium model. amongst the
    conclusions are the following' northeastern ohio will continue
    to provide 40% of the professional employment opportunities in
    the state through 1990; a new graduate school will not be
    warranted in the 1980s because of the tight job market; and
    transfer of kent's programme to columbus would leave a serious

    <text>dewey' the neglected introduction. dewey's introduction
    has been dropped from the current 19th edition of the
    classification scheme. perhaps because of its allegedly
    phonetic spelling it has been neglected. however, since it is
    considered that this introduction says everything which can be
    said about library classification it is considered that it
    should not now be forgotten. however the failure to relate the
    theory in the introduction to the actual arrangement of the
    subjects within the schedules set the unfortunate pattern by
    which library classification came to be discussed with little
    or no reference to the subject matter involved. the fact that
    dewey survives as the most widely used classification reflects
    the physical difficulty of trying to reclassify any established
    library and the lack of any new thinking in educational
    curricula. there is no evidence that later schemes represent

    position to evaluate the scientific and technical potential of
    r &amp; d groups and to forecast labour consumption and
    expenditure connected with new projects. such evaluations must
    be based on an analysis of literature data, inventions and

    <text>amesplot-a higher level data plotting software system
    amesplot is an extensible software system designed to make the
    display of data as simple, painless, and neat as possible. the
    system described is hardware-independent and has been
    implemented on a variety of installations, of different
    manufacturers, having diverse configurations. the elements
    common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in
    which these elements may be combined into a system based on
    simple modules is demonstrated. these modules are specified
    independently and are independent of the axis systems or other
    attributes of the plot. this enables plots of any complexity to
    be constructed by adding or replacing modules. the basic syntax
    of amesplot is outlined, and a brief description is given of
    its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
    self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with
    subplots, map coastlines, and 3-d plots. the system was
    formulate d in a way such that the user could supply the
    minimum of information, and it should be fully integrable with
    user's program written in most conventional higher languages.
    the functions of positioning, locating, and scaling (in the
    layout of multiple subplots) of axes, labels, and all other
    elements of the plot are handled automatically by the software
    system unless the user specifies otherwise. the structuring of
    plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is
    described. transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or
    shifting of entire plots or subplots by the action of one or
    more simple modules is possible. the user may interact freely
    with amesplot at three levels, enabling him to construct his
    own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations,
    and to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

    <text>the use of interactive graphics to solve numerical
    problems with the advent of on-line (time-sharing) computer
    systems and graphic terminals, we have available a new
    dimension in numerical problem solving capabilities. rather
    than simply use the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we
    can develop interactive routines which are easy to use and also
    take advantage of the insight and visual capabilities of the
    human problem solver. several on-line systems for general
    purpose mathematical problem solving have already been
    implemented as well as some special purpose systems for solving
    problems in a particular area such as ordinary differential
    equations. the advantage of restricting the problem area is
    that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified. in
    this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such
    systems and design considerations for interactive routines.
    furthermore, an implementation of an on-line least squares
    data-fitting program, peg, is presented with results obtained
    from empirical data. in conclusion, area for future work in
    this field are discussed. october, 1970 smith, l. b.

    <text>questions of library didactics. the comprehensive school
    library at kassel-waldau, which is also a public library, is a
    pilot project in the kassel area. instruction in library use is
    part of the school curriculum. introductory talks are given in
    the classrooms by teachers, after which the librarian provides
    about 10 hours of basic instruction in the library on media,
    use of catalogues and library procedures. then children work in
    the library, finding material on subjects of interest and
    preparing little talks on them. librarian and teachers advise
    on choice of material and the best ways of extracting
    information. close cooperation between librarian and teachers
    is essential. teachers receive instruction on school libraries
    at regional advanced training conferences.</text>

    <text>analyses of deterministic parsing algorithms this paper
    describes an approach for determining the minimum, maximum, and
    average times to parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic
    parser. these quantities are presented in the form of symbolic
    formulas, called time-formulas. the variables in these formulas
    represent not only the length of the input string but also the
    time to perform elementary operations such as pushing, popping,
    subscripting, iterating, etc. by binding to the variables
    actual numerical values corresponding to a given
    compiler-machine configuration, one can determine the execution
    time for that configuration. time-formulas are derived by
    examining the grammar rules and the program representing the
    algorithm one wishes to analyze. the approach is described by
    using a specific grammar that defines simple arithmetic
    expressions. two deterministic parsers are analyzed: a top-down
    recursive descent ll(1) parser, and a bottom-up slr(1) parser.
    the paper provides estimates for the relative efficiencies of
    the two parsers. the estimates applicable to a specific
    machine, the pdp-10, are presented and substantiated buy
    benchmarks. finally, the paper illustrates the proposed
    approach by applying it to the analyses of parsers for a simple
    programming language. june, 1978 cohen, j. roth, m.s. syntactic

    <text>complete catalogue of old printed works in cyrillic and
    glagolitic characters' basic theory and methodology. there has
    been a growing demand for a complete catalogue of cyrillic and
    glagolitic printed works of the 15th-17th centuries. in 1979
    the 1st volume of a complete catalogue was published by the
    lenin library. the 2description of old printed works in
    cyrillic characters1 is in many ways a trial edition. the
    methodology used presents a chronological catalogue of the old
    printed works with short bibliographical descriptions, details
    of all known copies and their whereabouts. a 2nd type of
    publication is being prepared simultaneously' the description
    of old cyrillic (eventually also glagolitic) characters
    (printed works) from particular printers. contributions towards
    the work of cataloguing the material are coming from libraries
    of all the slavic nations and from scholars of the subject
    throughout the world.</text>

    in 1978. at these aec, children played, heard music, read,
    looked at pictures in a 3-year aesthetic education programme,
    involving meeting artists, musicians, and children's librarians
    after school. the 1st year comprised' musical education, art,
    library and bibliographic knowledge. the 2nd year included'
    russian folk art, where the children compiled stories, learnt
    about folk festivals and dances, drew their favourite heroes.
    in the experimental classes children learn well, are more
    confident in class, more organised and have a richer
    vocabulary. all are library readers. results show the need to
    introduce this programme to 1st-formers in all ust'-ilimsk

    <text>the romanization of cyrillic script. in terms of

    english language production. however, there is still no
    generally accepted scheme in the western world for converting
    cyrillic characters into roman script. transcription, by which
    cyrillic characters are romanized into phonemes, gives good
    results for pronunciation but leads to a number of alternative
    spellings, whilst transliteration, by which a single roman
    character is substituted for each cyrillic character leads to
    pronunciation difficulties. with the growth in schemes for
    catalogue automation it is essential that a solution is found
    to this problem. research has shown that the iso standard
    offers the best solution although this has unfortunately found
    little favour in the usa and uk.</text>

    <text>time-sharing and batch-processing: an experimental
    comparison of their values in a problem - solving situation an
    experimental comparison of problem-solving using time-sharing
    and batch-processing computer systems conducted at mit is
    described in this paper. this study is the first known attempt
    to evaluate two such systems for what may well be the
    predominant user population within the next decade-the
    professionals who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as
    an aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather than as a
    programming end in itself. statistically and logically
    significant results indicate equal cost for usage of the two
    computer systems; however, a much higher level of performance
    is attained by time-sharing users. there are indications that
    significantly lower costs would have resulted if the
    time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached a
    performance level equal to that of the batch users. the users'
    speed of problem-solving and their attitudes made time-sharing
    the more favorable system. may, 1969 gold, m. m. time-sharing

    <text>eliminating monotonous mathematics with formac the formac
    (formula manipulation compiler) programming system provides a
    powerful tool for performing mathematical analysis. it is an
    extension of fortran iv which permits the use of the computer
    to perform the tedious algebraic computations that arise in
    many different fields. among the areas in which it has been
    successfully used are: differentiation of complicated
    expressions, expansion of truncated power series, solution of
    simultaneous equations with literal coefficients, nonlinear
    maximum likelihood estimation, tensor analysis, and generation
    of the coefficients of equations in keplerian motion. these
    types of analysis-which arose in the solution of specific
    practical problems in physics, engineering, astronomy,
    statistics and astronautics-are discussed in the paper. in
    addition to its usage for specific problem solutions, formac
    can also be used to automate the analysis phase in certain
    production programming. several such applications are
    presented. october, 1966 tobey, r. g. ca661002 jb march 2, 1978

    <text>directed random generation of sentences the problem of
    producing sentences of a transformational grammar by using a
    random generator to create phrase structure trees for input to
    the lexical insertion and transformational phases is discussed.
    a purely random generator will produce base trees which will be
    blocked by the transformations, and which are frequently too
    long to be of practical interest. a solution is offered in the
    form of a computer program which allows the user to constrain
    and direct the generation by the simple but powerful device of
    restricted subtrees. the program is a directed random generator
    which accepts as input a subtree with restrictions and produces
    around it a tree which satisfies the restrictions and is ready
    for the next phase of the grammar. the underlying linguistic
    model is that at noam chomsky, as presented in aspects of the
    theory of syntax. the program is written in fortran iv for the
    ibm 360/67 and is part of a unified computer system for

    <text>a learning program which plays partnership dominoes a

    information, the program uses somewhat different principles of
    artificial intelligence from those used in programs for games
    of complete information, such as checkers, chess, and go. the
    program was constructed to use a "strategy signature table"
    which classifies board situations through the interactions of
    game parameters. each entry in the table contains adaptively
    determined weights indicating the advi sability of various
    strategies. once chosen, a strategy then employs probability
    analysis and linear polynomial evaluation to choose a move. our
    program wins approximately two-thirds of its games in
    tournament situations, and has defeated championship players.

    enables one to perform much of the checking of security only
    once at translation time rather than repeatedly at execution
    time. the model is used to explain security features of several

    <text>data-tagging experiment for energy-related documents at

    incorporating data tags into secondary information files. tags
    are brief codes that indicate the presence in a primary
    document of specific types of numerical data. tags were
    selected in cooperation with users of the u.s. department of
    energy's (doe) recon system and added to a special version of
    the computer-readable energy file. recon users assisted in an
    evaluation of the tagging process. it was found that data tags
    do increase access to numerical data in the primary literature,
    but a file spanning several years is necessary to produce
    useful results. evaluation of processing costs revealed that
    after the initial training period, costs were not significantly
    greater for the number and types of data tags employed in this
    study. the feasibility of including data tags in nonenergy
    sections of 2chemical abstracts 1was examin ed with primary
    emphasis on economic and editorial factors. it was shown that
    subject content governs the selection of data types to be

    <text>dynamic microprogramming: processor organization and
    programming a dynamically microprogrammed processor is
    characterized by a small (4^k 64-bit word) read-write "micro"
    storage. the access time of this storage is similar to the
    cycle time of the machine (50-100 nsec). this microstorage is
    used to contain both data and subroutines. the (micro)
    instructions in such a processor differ from the conventional
    in that they perform only purely combinatorial operations;
    sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction. the
    presence of the read-write microstorage permits a more flexible
    assignment of resources than the read-only storage. in
    particular, the processor developed in this paper stresses the
    simultaneous operation (within the microinstruction) of the
    adder, shifter, masker, and testing facilities of the
    processor. a microassembly language is developed and the
    overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed. the
    efficiency of a flexible software linkage scheme is examined as
    to its overhead for various subroutine characteristics.
    finally, three examples of problem-oriented programming are
    considered and the resulting coding is compared against a
    system/360 assembly language version, with the technology
    normalized. april, 1971 tucker, a. b. flynn, m. j.

    <text>the use of printed cards of the all-union book chamber in

    printed cards of the all-union book chamber. in the past, the
    library staff had to fill in 7 full sets of the cards, despite
    the fact that only 20-30% of the cards were actually used in
    catalogues. instead of full sets the library now uses serial
    sets. depending on the subject of the catalogued document (for
    example literature on humanities is included in 3 catalogues),
    1-8 copies of the serial set cards are filled in. their use
    resulted in a considerable financial saving and in reduced
    labour consumption. the processing of the printed cards is

    <text>professional computer work for the blind developments in
    computer technology have opened new professional opportunities
    for the intelligent blind. since there are few if any
    occupations in which the blind can participate without serious
    disadvantage, the opportunities offered them to gain entrance
    into various occupations through computer use including that of
    programmer, is important for future rehabilitation planning.
    also of immediate interest is the fact that the blind may be
    especially suited for programming work. because of intense
    training in and constant experience with locating objects in
    the unseen environment and also because of superbly trained
    memory, the blind brings to the work of programming skills
    which the sighted has had little need to acquire. these
    qualifications should result in fewer debugging problems and
    make the blind a valuable addition to any systems group. before
    the blind could become a serious professional, a number of aids
    and techniques had to be developed that can mediate between
    machines and programmer. this paper describes the techniques
    and aids which were designed by the staff of the medical

    <text>a simple user-oriented compiler source language for
    programming automatic test equipment for the nonprogrammer,
    difficulty in using a language increases rapidly with the
    number of nonproblem-oriented conventions. a simple language,
    even if inelegant, which considers the user's background as
    part of the problem may be more effective than a source
    language containing subtle and more powerful capabilities. the
    language described in this paper is used to write computer
    programs which test electronic equipment. because this testing
    process contains few complex ideas, there is little need for
    the elegance and redundancy of a highly syntax-oriented
    language. a simple and direct language will suffice for the
    problem. the eventual users of this language are military depot
    personnel who cannot he expected to have computer programming
    skill or significant programming training. for this
    nonprogramming-oriented user, it was essential to create a
    language using familiar engineering statements;
    programming-oriented conventions would have unnecessarily

    describes its function and present organisational structure.
    designated the national library in the 1920s the library is
    also the centre for foreign materials in humanities. the main
    duties of the library are' systematic acquisition of materials,
    administration of interlibrary loans, compilation of the
    austrian national bibliography, the austrian publications
    collection (austriatica), conversion of the author catalogue
    into international format, retrospective indexing, reader
    services including exhibitions, participation in international

    <text>libraries in a society of pictorial abundance' do they
    honour their responsibility?. paper given at the swedish
    library association's annual meeting. describes technical
    developments in the video field, which are likely to lead to an
    abundance of pictures competing on our tv screens. this
    situation has both problems and possibilities. the output of
    video cassettes consists mainly of low quality action films and
    the delay in the plans for distribution of swedish tv
    programmes, which should heighten the quality, is regrettable.
    but the new distribution system also offers new freedom of
    choice and independence of transmission times. video techniques
    are useful for minorities such as the deaf and immigrants. the
    videogram commission therefore recommends that libraries should
    show video films, lend them and transmit them via cable.</text>

    public library, new york, was one of the first to build up a
    video collection; its film study center, begun in 1958,
    expanded in 1975 with the establishment of the video center.
    the center has 700 titles and access to 200 non-commercially
    produced programmes. boulder public library, colorado, has a
    media department with 250 videograms of a wide variety and its
    own video production. in 1978 it began to set up a video
    reference centre for colorado. fort washington public library,
    near new york, has had a media workshop, media port, since
    1973, consisting of a photo, video and film workshop, art
    department, and media reference centre. the aim of the workshop
    is to give the local population a chance to express themselves
    through these media. transmission of locall y produced
    programmes by the library on the local tv is planned. the

    <text>finding zeros of a polynomial by the q-d algorithm a
    method which finds simultaneously all the zeros of a
    polynomial, developed by h. rutishauser, has been tested on a
    number of polynomials with real coefficients. this slowly
    converging method (the quotient-difference (q-d) algorithm)
    provides starting values for a newton or a bairstow algorithm
    for more rapid convergence. necessary and sufficient conditions
    for the existence of the q-d scheme are not completely known;
    however, failure may occur when zeros have equal, or nearly
    equal magnitudes. success was achieved, in most of the cases
    tried, with the failures usually traceable to the equal
    magnitude difficulty. in some cases, computer roundoff may
    result in errors which spoil the scheme. even if the q-d
    algorithm does not give all the zeros, it will usually find a
    majority of them. september, 1965 henrich, p. watkins, b. o.

    given in analytical form. in solving non-linear boundary-value
    problems using quasilinearization many partial derivatives must
    be formed analytically and then evaluated numerically.
    wengert's method appears very attractive from the programming

    the concept should demand a fundamental unity of purpose agreed
    between local councillors and administration and provide tasks
    for the library without pedantic emphasis on theoretical
    niceties. the use of electronic data processing can assist in
    explaining the purposes and functions of librarianship to the
    administration. libraries must express the need for
    administrative reform through their staff associations. current
    plans for library development should be reassessed. federal
    ministries and advisory centres should be more closely involved
    with libraries and more use should be made of mass media

    texture edges in the picture are detected, and solid regions
    surrounded by these (usually broken) edges are "colored in"
    using a propagation process. the resulting map is cleaned by
    comparing the region colors with the textures of the
    corresponding regions in the picture, and also by merging some
    regions with others according to criteria based on topology and
    size. the method has been applied to the construction of cloud
    cover maps from cloud cover pictures obtained by satellites.

    specific proposed appendices to the canadian standards for
    hospital libraries. the study quantifies hospital library
    resources and services in a state with a substantial number of
    acute care facilities. 67.6% of those studies were judged as
    meeting either the revised jcah or the canadian criteria. the
    central finding is that the 100- to 299-bed hospitals reflect a
    significant number of deficiencies when evaluated against

    <text>person-matching by electronic methods record linkage in
    the updating of files is accomplished in many establishments
    through the use of a preassigned number, such as payroll
    number, customer number, or social security number. in vital
    and health records, however, a unique number is generally not
    preassigned to an individual for purposes of reporting services
    received to the health department. in order to determine
    whether different physician reports refer to the same
    individual, name and other identification must be compared.
    this is a laborious operation which is subject to various
    errors because of name misspellings, changes of name upon
    marriage, and other problems. we are interested in the
    maintenance of a psychiatric case register in maryland, where
    many of the reports from over a hundred psychiatric agencies
    refer to the same patient. these records must be linked in
    order to provide unduplicated counts of individuals under care
    and longitudinal records of psychiatric history. an earlier
    paper [1] describes our general procedures for register
    maintenance by use of a digital computer (honeywell 800). here
    we present in more detail our initial procedures for the
    person-matching process in order to elicit comments and
    suggestions from persons who have had experience in matching.

    the noninteger powers makes this more realistic than the usual

    <text>the campaign for public libraries in new south wales,
    1929-1950. the period 1890-1930 witnessed a decline in the
    number of public libraries in new south wales but by 1930
    several prominent citizens began to see them as useful adjuncts
    to the campaign to improve australian education. the carnegie
    corporation of new york provided financial support and the free
    library movement was set up in sydney. mass demand for public
    libraries was not really a motive force in the revival. world
    war 2 emphasised the need to preserve democracy through
    education and also established the idea that culture was not
    the preserve of the intellectual elite alone. post-war
    reconstruction brought with it a tide of largely british
    immigrants who had higher expectations of public library
    services. the impetus provided by the war was short lived,
    however, and public libraries were forced to stand alone. this
    time they were able to survive through the professionalism of
    the librarians.</text>

    <text>median split trees: a fast lookup technique for
    frequently occuring keys split trees are a new technique for
    searching sets of keys with highly skewed frequency
    distributions. a split tree is a binary search tree each node
    of which contains two key values-a node value which is a
    maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split value which
    partitions the remaining keys (with respect to their lexical
    ordering) between the left and right subtrees. a median split
    tree (mst) uses the lexical median of a node's descendents as
    its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly
    balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation of
    the tree and high search speed. unlike frequency ordered binary
    search trees, the cost of a successful search of an mst is log
    n bounded and very stable around minimal values. further, an
    mst can be built for a given key ordering and set of
    frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an optimum
    binary search tree. a discussion of the application of mst's to
    dictionary lookup for english is presented, and the performance
    obtained is contrasted with that of other techniques. november,

    firm of bertelsmann. in 1980, since existing accommodation was
    too small, an architects' competition was held to design a new
    library based on the '3-tier system'. details are given of the
    top 5 designs. the winner has placed on the ground floor a
    passage running right through the library to the park beyond;
    off this passage is the '1st tier' of popular fiction and
    non-fiction, issue counter and readers' cafe with newspapers.
    the 1st and 2nd floors house more fiction, non-fiction and
    periodicals; the 2nd floor also houses study carrels, media
    centre, conference room, stack, art centre and offices. the
    administration section is on the 3rd floor and the children's
    library on the lower ground floor.</text>

    co-operative interlending in the usa. revised version of a
    paper presented at the international seminar on national
    document provision, boston spa, 22-24 sept 80. recent us
    developments have favoured decentralised networks rather than
    centralised resource libraries. us libraries lack central
    planning and funding, and progress depends on individual
    library initiatives. in the last 10 years this has resulted in
    oclc, rlg, wln and 20 regional networks. describes the 3 major
    computer computer utilities. these computer networks would be
    complemented not duplicated by central resource libraries; with
    the national periodicals center effectively shelved, the center
    for research libraries could assume a more dynamic role.
    commercial vendors are often overlooked, but are an important
    element in document delivery systems. they are completely
    outside conventional library systems, and might cream off the

    limited to scientific and technological information
    communicated between research scientists and research engineers

    that there is a significant relationship between a scientist's

    <text>a scheduling philosophy for multiprocessing systems a
    collection of basic ideas is presented, which have been evolved
    by various workers over the past four years to provide a
    suitable framework for the design and analysis of
    multiprocessing systems. the notions of process and state
    vector are discussed, and the nature of basic operations on
    processes is considered. some of the connections between
    processes and protection are analyzed. a very general approach
    to priority-oriented scheduling is described, and its
    relationship to conventional interrupt systems is explained.
    some aspects of time-oriented scheduling are considered. the
    implementation of the scheduling mechanism is analyzed in
    detail and the feasibility of embodying it in hardware
    established. finally, several methods for interlocking the
    execution of independent processes are presented and compared.

    <text>trac, a procedure-describing language for the reactive
    typewriter a description of the trac (text reckoning and
    compiling) language and processing algorithm is given. the trac
    language was developed as the basis of a software package for
    the reactive typewriter. in the trac language, one can write
    procedures for accepting, naming and storing any character
    string from the typewriter; for modifying any string in any
    way; for treating any string at any time as an executable
    procedure, or as a name, or as text; and for printing out any
    string. the trac language is based upon an extension and
    generalization to character strings of the programming concept
    of the "macro." through the ability of trac to accept and store
    definitions of procedures, the capabilities of the language can
    be indefinitely extended, and can deal with character strings,
    integers and boolean vector variables. march, 1966 mooers, c.

    <text>interactive skeleton techniques for enhancing motion
    dynamics in key frame animation a significant increase in the
    capability for controlling motion dynamics in key frame
    animation is achieved through skeleton control. this technique
    allows an animator to develop a complex motion sequence by
    animating a stick figure representation of an image. this
    control sequence is then used to drive an image sequence
    through the same movement. the simplicity of the stick figure
    image encourages a high level of interaction during the design
    stage. its compatibility with the basic key frame animation
    technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively to
    only those components of a composite image sequence that
    require enhancement. october, 1976 burtnyk, n. wein, m.

    guidelines for standards of public library service published in

    of standards in public library service contain no discussion of
    the background to the suggested standards. some sections of the

    gives the report an unbalanced appearance. it is also
    noteworthy that no standards for staffing are included. in

    <text>a simple automatic derivative evaluation program a
    procedure for automatic evaluation of total/partial derivatives
    of arbitrary algebraic functions is presented. the technique
    permits computation of numerical values of derivatives without
    developing analytical expressions for the derivatives. the key
    to the method is the decomposition of the given function, by
    introduction of intermediate variables, into a series of
    elementary functional steps. a library of elementary function
    subroutines is provided for the automatic evaluation and
    differentiation of these new variables. the final step in this
    process produces the desired function's derivative. the main
    feature of this approach is its simplicity. it can be used as a
    quick-reaction tool where the derivation of analytical
    derivatives is laborious and also as a debugging tool for
    programs which contain derivatives. august, 1964 wengert, r. e.

    method can unnecessarily degrade small eigenvalues, while the

    <text>book thefts from university libraries as a legal problem.
    the theft of books from large, open-plan university libraries
    is a many-sided problem. it has reached such proportions that
    it is costing universities in west germany tens of thousands of
    dm every year and special detector systems have been installed
    in some libraries. these have led to many would-be thefts being
    prevented and charges being brought for theft. however, the
    majority of these charges have had to be dropped owing to
    loopholes in laws applicable to book thefts. german criminal
    law stipulates that the intention of keeping an object must be
    present to constitute a theft; this is usually impossible to
    prove in the case of book thefts. university administrative law
    also fails to provide adequate penalties and varies from one
    state to the next. it is necessary to define the theft of books
    as an offence in administrative law, punishable by a fine
    throughout west germany.</text>

    <text>interference in multiprocessor computer systems with
    interleaved memory this paper analyzes the memory interference
    caused by several processors simultaneously using several
    memory modules. exect results are computed for a simple model
    of such a system. the limiting value is derived for the
    relative degree of memory interference as the system size
    increases. the model of the limiting behavior of the system
    yields approximate results for the simple model and also
    suggests that the results are valid for a much larger class of
    models, including those more nearly like real systems that the
    simple model are tested against some measurements of program
    behavior and simulations of systems using memory references
    from real programs. the model results provide a good indication
    of the performance that should be expected from real system of
    this type. june, 1976 baskett, f. smith, a. j. memory, memory

    <text>index system for personal reference sources. several
    norwegian business information organisations cooperated during
    1974-76 to develop a computerised reference system (usis) for
    linking enquirers with personal, not bibliographical, reference
    sources. people produce knowledge; the human brain is an
    unsurpassed 'data base'; and precise information can be
    requested and obtained through conversation. the basic
    reference unit chosen was the specialist department or
    institution, and in apr 79 1,200 reference sources were
    registered, representing 550 norwegian institutions. indexing
    of sources is based on annual reports, checked by the
    institutions. institutions can be approached individually if
    the problem requires precise definition, or the index used
    alone via a computer terminal. data on personal reference
    sources must be constantly updated. similar systems exist in
    other countries, and the idea could be extended' all users of
    computer terminals (8,000 in norway in 1978, estimated to reach
    2 0,000 in 1985) are potential clients. possible dangers of
    monopoly, abuse, or takeover by a foreign power should be
    technically avoidable.</text>

    long-standing struggle for proper library premises has taken
    place; the library, having few means, was moved from 1
    temporary place to another until it could be moved into a new
    building in 1970. in feb 73 a volcanic eruption hit the heimaey
    and destroyed the library, but the books were rescued. it is

    <text>machine independence: its technology and economics a
    survey is offered of techniques for transferring programs, and

    methods examined, the "bootstrap" technique is singled out for
    detailed discussion, with emphasis on its economics. the
    considerations that determine the applicability of
    bootstrapping in any specific case are discussed, and an
    attempt is made to assign appropriate qualitative weights to
    them. finally, reasons are given for believing that the
    machine-independence problem is being substantially diminished
    by current trends in computer design, and that it is this
    process of convergence in hardware design rather than any
    foreseeable software developments that will lead to its

    national health service establishments. their editorial staff
    make every effort to impart information to their readers, not

    into the readers psychology, the situation in a similar field
    abroad, the latest publications, important events of public

    <text>auto-indexing of the 1971-77 abi/inform database.
    explains why it was decided not to index abi/inform when it
    began in 1971 and why this decision was reversed in 1977. index
    terms were automatically assigned to the 65,000 abstracts in
    the on-line data base on 31 dec 77 and controlled vocabulary
    and index term assignment were introduced for all entries from
    the jan 78 update onwards. the indexed data base became
    available in late spring 78. describes the automatic indexing
    procedure; gives examples of resultant false drops in searches;
    lists the advantages of introducing indexing; and outlines
    possible future enhancements to the data base.</text>
