    <text>public libraries as a compulsory provision by local

    position of local authority cultural services must be clarified
    in the 1980s. the library service is a part of local culture
    that cannot be overlooked and so it is essential for each
    library to cooperate with other libraries, cultural
    organisations and local government administrators. a decision
    is needed as to whether local authorities are not only entitled
    but also obliged to administer public libraries. the concept of
    a national library law should be renounced in favour of a
    concept whereby local authorities impose on themselves the
    obligation to provide public libraries. local communities
    should draw up their own library plans and provide the money;
    each state should then provide financial assistance for library
    work outside these areas.</text>

    <text>performance of height-balanced trees this paper presents
    the results of simulations that investigate the performance of
    height-balanced (hb[k]) trees. it is shown that the only
    statistic of hb[1] trees (avl trees) that is a function of the
    size of the tree is the time to search for an item in the tree.
    for sufficiently large trees, the execution times of all
    procedures for maintaining hb[1] trees are independent of the
    size of the tree. in particular, an average of .465
    restructures are required per insertion, with an average of
    2.78 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1] property; an average
    of .214 restructures are required per deletion, with an average
    of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1] property.
    moreover,the execution times of procedures for maintaining
    hb[k] trees, for k&gt;1, are also independent of the size of
    the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a
    delete operation in order to restore the hb[k] property on
    trace back. the cost of maintaining hb[k] trees drops sharply
    as the allowable imbalance (k) increases. both analytical and
    experimental results that show the cost of maintaining hb[k]
    trees as a function of k are discussed. january, 1976 karlton,

    language designed to simplify communication between man and
    machine through remote typewriter console. it has been
    developed for retrieval of documents from a computerized data
    base, the moore school information systems laboratory files.
    requests are formulated in a standardized syntactical form
    (examples of which are presented), and this form is then
    transformed into an equivalent query expressed in the retrieval
    system's original symbolic command language, which is briefly
    described. operation of easy english is detailed by
    illustration of the transformations performed upon a sample
    request up to the point at which the request string is sent to
    the system. a macro flowchart of easy english is included, and
    an appendix provides the printout of a retrieval demonstration.

    input-output equipment. physical characteristics of the
    two-disk system (4,194,304 72-bit words, 8 usec-per-word
    transmission rate, etc.) are noted. timing limitations due to
    arm motion and disk rotation are discussed. applications of
    disk usage are discussed separately for problem programs and
    for systems programs such as compilers and the supervisory
    program. approximately 260,000 words of disk storage are
    reserved for the storage of systems programs and the subroutine
    library. problem programs, however, are not currently filed on
    the disk. certain programming techniques are discussed for
    transmitting words between disk and core storage with minimum
    delaying and interruption of the arithmetic unit. dumps on disk
    are considered for both recovery from computer malfunction and
    for mathematical or physical developments during the
    calculation. some comments are made regarding the reliability,
    economics, utility and weaknesses or limitations of the disk
    system. several possible future applications are noted which

    <text>corporate authorship-its role in library cataloguing. an
    exploration of previous attempts to provide a satisfactory
    justification for the treatment of corporate bodies as authors
    reveals a history of partial answers and insufficiently
    detailed analyses both of corporate authorship in particular
    and of authorship in general. the reason for the failures
    probably rests in the fact that authorship is both a complex
    phenomenon and necessarily such a fundamental concept in the
    construction of a library catalogue that it is taken for
    granted. part i deals with the development of the concept of
    corporate authorship and part ii with the nature of authorship
    in general under the headings' authorship by origination,
    authorship by assumption of responsibility, corporate
    utterances and corporate authorship. in conclusion relates

    <text>library service to university-based continuing education
    for management. outlines the development of management
    education in australia, and discusses the work of the library
    of the australian graduate school of management (a
    semi-autonomous institution within the university of new south
    wales). describes the methods used by the school's librarian to
    update managers' awareness of what is available from libraries
    and other sources in australia in the 1980s. notes the need for
    more research into how the needs of managers in private
    enterprise and the public sector could be met.</text>

    <text>some problems with part-time courses in librarianship. in
    addition to fulltime courses offered by the school of
    librarianship in sofia, part-time courses, i.e. in-service
    courses, help to increase the number of qualified librarians.
    from 1960 to 1976, 936 part-time students enrolled, and 834,
    i.e. 89%, completed their studies including 16 students from
    the cyril and methodius national library. 99% of the students
    were women, who were forced frequently to extend their studies
    beyond 3 years because of maternity leave, illness and other
    reasons. in future, the central libraries, in particular, must
    help to select suitable candidates as prospective part-time
    students. libraries also have a duty to intensify their
    assistance to enrolled part-time students, provide help during
    the course as well as to assist those students who are
    preparing for final examinations and theses. only then can
    part-time courses gradually become an equivalent to fulltime
    study.</text>

    <text>muse: a model to understand simple english muse is a
    computer model for natural language processing, based on a
    semantic memory network like that of quillian's tlc. muse, from
    a model to understand simple english, processes english
    sentences of unrestricted content but somewhat restricted
    format. the model first applies syntactic analysis to eliminate
    some interpretations and then employs a simplified semantic
    intersection procedure to find a valid interpretation of the
    input. while the semantic processing is similar to tlc's, the
    syntactic component includes the early use of parse trees and
    special purpose rules. the "relational triple" notation used
    during interpretation of input is compatible with muse's memory
    structures, allowing direct verification of familiar concepts
    and the addition of new ones. muse also has a repertoire of
    actions, which range from editing and reporting the contents of
    its own memory to an indirect form of question answering.
    examples are presented to demonstrate how the model interprets
    text, resolves ambiguities, adds information to memory,
    generalizes from examples and performs various actions.

    concluding that there is hope for the profession if' (1) the
    profession itself realises that it is both a science and a

    there they must realign themselves with academic historians and
    others to produce a body of basic principles, a system of

    <text>on demands to remodel library conditions at the 5 'old'
    universities (technical colleges) in the state of north
    rhine-westphalia. the 1979/80 library guide to the aachen
    university library functions simultaneously as a critique of
    conditions at the library. aachen is now a university with
    almost 30,000 students but the library system is largely
    decentralised with many small institute libraries. some of
    these have been reorganised and rehoused, but many still need
    to be restructured. there is a lack of centralisation and
    coordination which can be found out most of the 'old' north
    rhine-westphalia universities which are not planned, campus
    universities. there is a need for a complete catalogue of
    library stock. library guides such as the aachen example are of
    great valueand should be published at all the libraries. it is
    also necessary to integrate small institute libraries to
    improve coordination work. librarians are of the opinion that
    libraries should be treated as individual cases and that plans
    and laws for remodelling library conditions should beware of
    generalisation.</text>

    communication between man and machine eliza is a program
    operating within the mac time-sharing system at mit which makes
    certain kinds of natural language conversation between man and
    computer possible. input sentences are analyzed on the basis of
    decomposition rules which are triggered by key words appearing
    in the input text. responses are generated by reassembly rules
    associated with selected decomposition rules. the fundamental
    technical problems with which eliza is concerned are: (1)the
    identification of key words, (2) the discovery of minimal
    context, (3) the choice of appropriate transformations, (4)
    generation of responses in the absence of key words, and (5)
    the provision of an editing capability for eliza "scripts". a
    discussion of some psychological issues relevant to the eliza
    approach as well as of future developments concludes the paper.

    <text>some aspects of the librarian-user relationship. argues
    that direct librarian-user interaction is long overdue for
    close scrutiny, since this relationship may not be in harmony
    with the overall standard of other subsystems of the
    information centre. points out that, apart from qualifications
    and experience, a librarian must also possess a personality
    which is psychologically well balanced and adaptable, since a
    great deal of his/her work involves exposure to potentially
    stressful situations. these situations arise with users who are
    poorly informed about the practical difficulties associated
    with obtaining a particular information source and who are not
    able to appreciate that other readers have their pressing
    requirements as well. name tags for librarians should lead to
    greater personal responsibility. in large libraries direct user
    contact involves shift working for the predominantly female
    staff; this leads to difficulties and sometimes less than
    adequate personnel are exposed to the pu blic. this area of
    library services cries out for a systematic overhaul.</text>

    whose texts are used as printer's copy for a fortnightly
    abstracting journal. 150,000 abstracts are stored at present.
    the tapes are the basis of input, coding and retrieval. the

    <text>a conceptual framework for a nonprocedural programming
    language a sequential programming language forces the
    programmer to prescribe explicitly the order in which the
    operations in his program have to be executed, even if the
    order is not relevant to the solution of his problem. the
    requirement to indicate irrelevant sequencing can be removed if
    the language provides facilities for specifying a task in a
    nonprocedural manner. in general, a program specified in this
    way will allow concurrent evaluation. this paper describes a
    conceptual framework for a high level programming language
    providing both nonprocedural and sequential facilities. within
    a program, nonprocedural and sequential program modules may be
    nested freely. december, 1977 kessels, j. l. w. parallel

    <text>a final solution to the dangling else of algol 60 and
    related languages the dangling else problem consists of a class
    of potential ambiguities in algol-like conditional statements
    whose basic form is "if b1 then if b2 then s1 else s2" where b1
    and b2 are boolean expressions and s1 and s2 are basic
    statements. the difficulty lies in whether to attach the else
    to the first if or to the second one. existing solutions to the
    problem are either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive. let
    sand s1 be statements. we define s to be closed if "s else s1"
    is not a statement, and to be open if "s else s1" is a
    statement. thus an unconditional statement is a closed
    statement. open and closed conditional statements are defined
    by syntax equations in such a way as to preserve openness and
    closure. in each case, an else must always be preceded by a
    closed statement. it is shown that the syntax equations are
    unambiguous, and that may change in the statement types
    required within the syntax equations would lead to either
    ambiguity or unnecessary restriction. september, 1966 abrahams,

    <text>a language extension for expressing constraints on data
    access controlled sharing of information is needed and
    desirable for many applications and is supported in operating
    systems by access control mechanisms. this paper shows how to
    extend programming languages to provide controlled sharing. the
    extension permits expression of access constraints on shared
    data. access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
    to objects that are components of larger objects, such as bank
    account records in a bank's data base. the constraints are
    stated declaratively, and can be enforced by static checking
    similar to type checking. the approach can be used to extend
    any strongly-typed language, but is particularly suitable for
    extending languages that support the notion of abstract data
    types. may, 1978 jones, a.k. liskov,b.h. programming languages,

    <text>british library lending division (in swedish). the blld

    and technology. the aim is that almost all orders from other
    libraries shall be fulfilled from the library's own stock and
    processed the same day. this necessitates a comprehensive
    acquisition policy, efficient work routines, and central
    location, at boston spa. its gift &amp; exchange section serves
    a useful function as deposit for withdrawn material from other
    libraries. a music collection is being built up. the largest
    departments are those for serials and books, and total stock
    comprises 4 million volumes and 2.5 million documents or
    fiches. all periodicals, but mainly english language monographs
    only, are acquired. special attention is given to coverage of
    russian scientific and technical publications. describes the
    selection methods. the routines are simple and few of the staff
    have higher education, emphasis bei ng on administrative
    skills. the services pay for themselves overall and the budget
    is generous. use of back-up libraries is made, mostly the legal
    deposit libraries. various catalogues are available, including

    <text>computer-aided analysis and design of information systems
    this paper describes the use of computer-aided analysis for the
    design and development of an integrated financial management
    system by the navy material command support activity (nmcsa).
    computer-aided analysis consists of a set of procedures and
    computer programs specifically designed to aid in the process
    of applications software design, computer selection and
    performance evaluation. there are four major components:
    problem statement language, problem statement analyzer,
    generator of alternative designs, and performance evaluator.
    the statement of requirements was written in ads (accurately
    defined systems) and analyzed by a problem statement analyzer
    for ads. the ads problem definition was supplemented with
    additional information in order to create a complete problem
    definition. the analyzed problem statement was translated to
    the form necessary for use by the soda (systems optimization
    and design algorithm) program for the generation of alternative
    specifications of program modules and logical database
    structures. december, 1976 nunamaker, j. f. jr. konsynski, b.

    <text>a phonological rule tester the design and implementation

    framework presented in the sound patterns of english by chomsky
    and halle, 1968, to define phonemes as bundles of specified
    distinctive features, to define data as strings of phonemes
    with associated grammatical structure, to test the effect of
    applying rules to the data, and to store both the definitions
    and results. the rule application facility described in detail
    was implemented by translating linguistic rules to rules in
    flip, a format-directed list processor embedded in lisp. this
    made the system construction easy while providing sophisticated
    capabilities for the linguist. the system is written in bbn

    <text>future plans for the ulscs. paper presented at a one-day

    3 apr 81. ulscs is merely a means to an end-that being a
    university-wide network for resource sharing in libraries. the
    system will provide many elements needed for a cooperative
    acquisitions programme, a shared data base to which all the
    system's libraries will contribute, and user access within the
    library and academic department of an on-line catalogue. the
    system should, however be seen in its place in the national
    network, and it will be accessed along with the marc files and
    save a geat deal of time.</text>

    <text>a model for automating file and program design in

    finding an efficient implementation of a business application
    system whose logical specifications have been determined in

    of systematically coordinating the configurations of datasets
    and computations. it uses a straight forward search technique
    to determine aggregations of computations, aggregations of
    datasets, device, organization, and key order for each data
    set, key order for each computation, and access method for each
    dataset-computation pair. although computational results are
    presented for a sample problem involving 54 computations and 49
    datasets, the main point of the paper is that the underlying
    model works computationally an d is simple enough to be adapted
    to many file design situations. june, 1979 alter, s. system

    <text>a programming system for the on-line analysis of

    are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes. the system is
    separated into four programming tasks: picture transformations,
    file maintenance, picture structuring, and display management.
    picture structuring is considered as the vehicle for
    man-machine communication. a prototype data format for
    pictures, called a picture-form, is developed. structure
    operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce
    new pictures-forms. many of the ideas are taken from the
    symbolic mathematical laboratory at mit conceived by marvin

    telecommunications industry is being debated in numerous
    regulatory proceedings, court cases, etc. central to these
    discussions are 'proper costs' and their relationships not only
    to prices but also to other benefits or burdens. costs have
    been allocated in the traditional telecommunications industry
    mainly by a 2-stage process. 1st, explicit jurisdictional
    separations have allocated costs hence revenue requirements
    among the federal and all the state jurisdictions. 2nd, pricing
    rather than costing policy has determined the further incidence
    of benefits and burdens in the general absence of explicit
    suballocations of costs within the pools of costs assigned to

    <text>the sl5 procedure mechanism this paper describes an

    is accomplished by treating procedures and their activation
    records (called environments) as data objects and by
    decomposing procedure invocation into three separate components
    at the source-language level. in addition, argument binding is
    under the control of the programmer, permitting the definition
    of various methods of argument transmission in the source
    language itself. the resulting procedure mechanism,which is
    part of the sl5 programming language, is well suited to
    goal-oriented problems and to other problems that are more
    readily programmed by using coroutines. several examples are

    <text>a language extension for graph processing and its formal
    semantics a simple programming language "extension," graspe,
    for processing directed graphs is defined. graspe consists of a
    type of directed graph data structure and a set of primitive
    operations for manipulating these structures. graspe may be
    most easily implemented by embedding it in a host language.
    emphasis is placed both on graspe itself and on its method of
    definition. commonly, the definition of a language involves
    definition of the syntactic elements and explanation of the
    meaning to be assigned them (the semantics). the definition of
    graspe here is solely in terms of its semantics; that is, the
    data structures and operations are defined precisely but
    without assignment of a particular syntactic representation.
    only when the language is implemented is assignment of an
    explicit syntax necessary. an example of an implementation of
    graspe embedded in lisp is given as an illustration. the
    advantages and disadvantages of the definition of a language in

    <text>recursive data structures in apl a mathematical study of
    three approaches for defining nested arrays in apl is
    presented. theorems exhibiting the relationships between the
    definitional systems are given and illustrated through graph
    representations. one of the approaches is used to define an apl
    array to be a recursive data structure equivalent to a tree
    structure in which all data is stored at the leaves as
    homogeneous arrays of numbers and characters. an extension of
    apl is proposed that includes new primitive functions to
    manipulate the nesting level of arrays and new operators to
    assist in the construction of data-driven algorithms. february,

    <text>lucid, a nonprocedural language with iteration lucid is a
    formal system in which programs can be written and proofs of
    programs carried out. the proofs are particularly easy to
    follow and straightforward to produce because the statements in
    a lucid program are simply axioms from which the proof proceeds
    by (almost) conventional logical reasoning, with the help of a
    few axioms and rules of inference for the special lucid
    functions. as a programming language, lucid is unconventional
    because, among other things, the order of statements is
    irrelevant and assignment statements are equations.
    nevertheless, lucid programs need not look much different than
    iterative programs in a conventional structured programming
    language using assignment and conditional statements and loops.

    public libraries in denmark is reviewed and doubts are cast on
    the genuineness of official danish liberalism in relation to
    the development of and attitude to libraries. schools and
    libraries originated from 2 entirely different concepts' in
    schools children had others to think for them; libraries in
    denmark arose from the late 19th century idea of culture for
    all and access for all to everything there was to know. by the
    1930s libraries had become instigators of culture, with
    lectures as well as books available, and were regarded as
    progressive in all its meanings. this is still the aim of
    libraries today, but schools and libraries have always belonged
    together and integration of the 2 is perfectly
    reasonable.</text>

    <text>an implemented graph algorithm for winning shannon
    switching games in this tutorial paper a computer program which
    wins shannon switching games is described. since these games
    are played on graphs, the program is a good example of the
    implementation of graph algorithms. the two players in a
    shannon switching game, connect and cut, have nonsimilar goals.
    either connect, cut, or the player moving first is guaranteed
    the existence of a winning strategy. the simple strategy
    explained in this paper is valid in all three cases. in fact,
    the major routines never need to know whether the computer is
    connect or cut. april, 1972 chase, s. m. graph algorithms,

    trees with standard avl trees and with balanced trees on the
    basis of mean retrieval time, of amount of restructuring
    expected, and on the worst case of retrieval time. it is shown
    that, by permitting imbalances of up to five units, the
    retrieval time is increased a small amount while the amount of
    restructuring required is decreased by a factor of ten. a few
    theoretical results are derived, including the correction of an

    <text>an improved index sequential access method using hashed
    overflow the index sequential access method (isam) is one of
    the most important file management systems used with moveable
    head disk devices. this study investigates the use of an
    unconventional method of treating overflow records. the method
    is to use hashing techniques to allocate space for such
    records. if certain conditions are satisfied, this is superior
    to the conventional isam method of chaining the overflow
    records via linked list techniques. these conditions are: long
    overflow chains with significant overflow; lack of tight disk
    space constraints; record keys which are small compared to the
    total record size; and significant use of the file in the index
    as opposed to the sequential mode. using hashed overflow, the
    time to locate a record is dependent not on the total volume of
    overflow records as in conventional isam, but on the percentage
    use of space dedicated to overflow records. may, 1972 mullin,

    <text>integration of thesauri in the social sciences. paper
    presented at the conta conference, bielefeld, 24-27 may 81.
    discusses the objectives and compilation of the proposed
    integrated thesaurus of the social sciences, which is intended
    to act as a master reference tool, as an aid in searching
    across data bases, or a switching mechanism. the 1st step in
    compilation should be the merging of terms to form a descriptor
    bank. to compare the merged terms at the concept level,
    analysis in sub-fields is proposed within a classification
    framework, preferably 1 with a faceted structure, such as the
    2nd edition of the 2bliss bibliographic classification. 1the
    classification would serve as the master against which the
    terms from the merged information languages, arranged in a
    compatibility matrix, would be compared. the master
    classification would be modified during interaction with the
    matrix terms, and emerge as the integrated thesaurus in a
    format similar to that of the bsi root thesaurus, having a d
    etailed classified display and full alphabetical section.
    provides an example worked out in the sub-field of unemployment
    using terms from 5 thesauri and the udc. also considers

    <text>studies on 2economics abstracts international1' a new
    online database. describes the results of a series of test
    searches carried out on 2economics abstracts international1
    (eai), a relatively new on-line bibliographic data base
    covering economics and marketing information. in particular,
    the data base was compared to the well-established predicasts
    family of data bases. it was found that they are complementary,
    in that for particular types of search (e.g. company
    information), predicasts is a better service and for others
    (e.g. theoretical economics) eai is superior. in the field of
    marketing information, both provide hits. predicasts identified
    short, up-to-date news items and eai in-depth studies. critical
    comments are made on geographic coverage, on the use of
    universal decimal classification numbers for subject-matter
    searching, and on the timeliness of eai.</text>

    <text>document: 'library organisation in eretz-yisrael' (in

    after world war i and it is then that he wrote this article,
    originally published in hapoel hatzair. library collections in
    eretz-yisrael are unplanned and not systematic, because they
    are based almost exclusively on gifts, rather than purchases.
    librarians must not obligate themselves to catalogue gift
    collections in toto, but must leave themselves free to choose
    only what is needed and to give away or exchange the rest. he
    calls for the foundation of a national union catalogue in
    jerusalem with far-reaching centralised powers to transfer
    books from 1 library to others where they will be more
    useful.</text>

    <text>library provision of music-a question of priorities.
    discusses the teaching of music librarianship in the danish
    library school. mentions a swedish protest letter against the
    proposed abolition of such teaching. although abolition is not
    suggested in denmark, much in the letter is applicable to
    danish conditions. it thus points out that libraries with their
    non-commercial objectives can counteract the predominance of
    large foreign record companies. it argues that now that music
    departments in libraries are being reduced, librarians should
    receive more instruction in music librarianship so that they
    can make better use of the limited resources. now when the
    training is to be revised, the opportunity should be grasped to
    give music a higher priority in the library school.</text>

    towards the development of user research methods, part i.
    hofmann and angermann carried out their research at the
    beginning of this century, during the period of the movement
    for popular education. they felt that library staff should know
    about each reader's requirements from and motivation towards
    reading so that the library could perform effectively its
    educative function. hofmann advocated the importance of
    personal contact between staff and readers and of typological
    grouping of readers with the aid of loan frequency statistics.
    his new classification system for subject indexes was used in
    compiling catalogues of the leipzig bucherhalle. hofmann also
    favoured the use of selective indexes aimed at target groups in
    addition to that of general catalogues.</text>

    <text>on the programme for library research. comments on the
    report by the library school's working party on a programme for
    library research, published autumn 80. the report shows lack of
    classification principles and clear definitions. thus the terms
    library research and library science are used interchangeably.
    the organisation of library research is not discussed, and how
    research at the school can be linked to ongoing field research
    is hardly dealt with. organizational contact with goteborg
    university, as suggested, is not enough, links should also be
    established with other research institutions and with the
    centre for interdisciplinary studies. the suggested appointment
    of a documentalist to document information on library research
    is praised. the programme should be sent to libraries and
    research institutions for discussion before decisions are
    made.</text>

    <text>library science and history' a dialectical approach.
    criticises conventional studies of library history for failing
    to appreciate that libraries are essentially part of an
    interlocking complex of institutions forming a particular
    social structure, which itself is determined by the historical
    process. shows how dialectical materialism can be used to deal
    with social entities as part of a totality of positive and
    negative factors, and emphasises the necessity of viewing
    history as a process and not as finite. once this is
    understood, it becomes possible to place the study of libraries
    on a recognisable scientific basis, as a complex of practices
    which are ultimately socially determined.</text>

    anniversary of the scientific library of the tomsk university).
    reviews the history and development and discusses the current
    work of the scientific library of tomsk university. when
    founded, in 1880, the library had a stock of approximately
    96,000 items consisting of valuable collections of books, which
    were either purchased or which the library received as gifts.
    initially the use was not very effective: during its first 10
    years the library handled on average only 5,000 loans per year.
    staff worked under extremely difficult conditions during the
    period 1941-44 when a herbarium and a museum were moved into
    its premises. in addition, during that period the library
    looked after the archives of a.m. gor'kii, l.n. tolstoi and
    a.s. pushkin. despite the difficult conditions, staff not only
    managed to continue their work but the library also provided a
    service to wounded soldiers receiving treatment in tomsk. the
    library has currently a stock of 3, 5 million items in more
    than 50 languages and an extensive collection of periodicals.
    in 1969 the library became a methodological centre for 46
    academic libraries. it organises over 300 book exhibitions a
    year.</text>

    <text>analyzing english syntax with a pattern-learning parser a
    dependency analysis system based on pattern recognition and
    learning logic was developed to infer word classes and rules of
    syntactic combination from experience with text which had been
    analyzed. the characteristics used to form word classes are the
    depth in the dependency tree of each word, the direction of its
    governor and the same features for each of its immediate
    neighbors. syntactic rules of combination show the relation of
    a word to its governor in the depth pattern of the sentence.
    the system was tested on 400 elementary basic english sentences
    including 300 used earlier by knowlton in a different learning
    parser of all 400 sentences. after experience with 300
    sentences it was able to generalize with 77 percent accuracy to
    the next 100. in accumulative learning trials after the first
    200 sentences it averaged a probability of .9 for accurately
    parsing each new sentence it encountered. it was concluded that
    the system is adequate for learning to parse the bulk of basic
    english but that further development is required before
    conclusions about its application to ordinary english can be
    stored. the system is operational and available on the arpa/sdc
    time-shared computing system. november, 1965 mcconlogue, k.

    <text>experiments and analysis on a computer interface to an
    information retrieval network. a primary goal of this project
    was to develop an interface that would provide direct access
    for inexperienced users to existing on-line bibliographic
    information retrieval networks. the experiment tested the
    concept of a virtual-system mode of access to a network of
    heterogeneous interactive retrieval systems and data bases. an
    experimental translating computer interface named conit was
    developed as a research test vehicle. the interface was
    designed to make the basic functions of 3 different
    bibliographic retrieval systems easy to use, even by
    inexperienced users, by providing a simplified common command
    language coupled with extensive on-line instruction. report not

    <text>a simply extended and modified batch environment
    graphical system (sembegs) sembegs is a complete batch
    environment graphical system containing components for handling
    graphical data files, for displaying the contents of these
    files on a variety of graphical hardware, and for performing
    graphical batch input operations. sembegs is easy to extend and
    modify to meet the growing needs of a large batch environment,
    and is even extendable to a fully interactive system. the paper
    presents the conceptual view of graphics leading to the design
    of sembegs and outlines the major components of the system. the
    design of sembegs is founded upon the basic assumption that the
    true aim of computer graphics is to describe graphical
    entities, rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical
    input and output functional capabilities. sembegs is built
    around a basic graphical data management system (bagdams) which
    provides a common means of communicating the descriptions of
    graphical entities between the various components of sembegs.
    bagdams provides facilities for storing, retrieving, and
    manipulating the descriptions of graphical entities provided
    by, and received by application programs, graphics packages,
    and graphical devices. november, 1978 wendorf, j.w. computer

    a debate among the members. the group presents its own
    suggestions' minor subjects should be gathered in larger
    subject groups; account should be taken in teaching of the
    trend to libraries staffed by a single librarian; the use of
    computers should not be a subject on its own, but taught in
    connection with all subject areas; teaching of russian could be
    confined to teaching of transliteration under cataloguing; the
    teaching of literature and information retrieval should give a
    theoretical basis for searching within any subject area and not
    aim to give thorough knowledge of particular subjects; and the
    new unified course should not include specialisation, but

    <text>the role of the network in automated acquisitions.
    contribution to the lita (american library association. library
    and information technology association) institute. examines
    non-profit bibliographic networks to assess why they offer, or
    plan to offer acquisitions services, what major contributions
    they can make, and the advantages and disadvantages of network
    acquisitions systems for individual libraries. networks can
    contribute significantly because cataloguing and acquisitions
    functions are complementary, and the networks can provide both
    acquisitions and in-process control over materials, thus
    allowing a library to operate more efficiently with improved
    internal controls. as a network system will display member
    holdings, cooperative acquisitions and interlibrary loan will
    also be facilitated.</text>

    <text>high level programming for distributed computing
    programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems
    is a problem of growing interest. this paper describes an
    approach to distributed computing at the level of general
    purpose programming languages. based on primitive notions of
    module, message, and transaction key, the methodology is shown
    to be independent of particular languages and machines. it
    appears to be useful for programming a wide range of tasks.
    this is part of an ambitious program of development in advanced
    programming languages, and relations with other aspects of the
    project are also discussed. june, 1979 feldman, j.a.

    <text>research in librarianship. the cyril and methodius

    indeed, the library network as a whole will benefit from the
    results. the issues under investigation include propaganda of
    literature, guided reading, open access in public libraries,
    audio-visual resources, new subject catalogues, library
    services in secondary schools, recommended bibliographies, and
    the relative importance of specialised book collections to

    <text>oclc-an american information system on its way to
    denmark. library automation began in 1965 with the first marc
    pilot project initiated by the library of congress and soon
    taken up by the british national bibliography. international
    standards have been drawn up to secure worldwide use of the
    system, culminating in the attempt to create universal
    bibliographic control. however, exchange of international
    bibliographic data has been beset by problems, so that
    international use of machine readable information is not very
    widespread. the use of international, english language based
    standards and exchange of actual tape have caused problems in
    scandinavia. for these reasons bibliographic service centres,
    'utilities', have been set up in usa and england, an idea which
    is also behind the danish systems samkat and biblioteksdata.
    the largest is the us oclc, which began in 1967. its main task
    is development of a bibliographic data base and decentralised
    cataloguing, which supplies the base with 60, 000 titles
    annually from 4,000 terminals. it also operates an interlending
    system, and hopes to add accessions and issue control systems
    to the services. the main product is catalogue cards. with the
    establishment of 'oclc europe', danish libraries will have to
    take a stand for or against cooperation with it.</text>

    <text>online periodicals at hull college of higher education.
    describes the operation, within the college's multi-site
    library, of an on-line periodicals control system, developed
    completely in-house, which replaced an inefficient manual
    system. each subscription record holds details of title,
    alternative title, location code and subject code and is
    composed of fixed-length fields with a-character alphanumeric
    control number. fields include frequency, issues per volume and
    price, and each entry may be termed 'alive' or 'inactive'.
    library records were then converted to machine-readable form
    and may now be sorted by location, type and subject/department.
    the simple accessioning procedures are detailed. the system
    which went live in jan 81 is proving very efficient in this

    <text>some current issues in planning for library automation at
    the state level. the connecticut automation coordinating
    committee (cacc) was formed in 1980 to provide an opportunity
    for all groups, libraries and organisations engaged in or
    interested in developing automated systems to meet regularly to
    share information and to begin an informal planning effort.
    discusses major issues that the cacc has faced which have
    implications for other states. a statewide on-line union
    catalogue is likely to consist of components developed
    independently by individual libraries or groups of libraries
    which have voluntarily adopted guidelines and standards
    suggested by the cacc. the role of the cacc is the
    identification of existing and emerging catalogues which might
    become components, the promotion of adequate access to those
    components and the assurance that there is a reasonable
    prospect of eventual linkage and integration of those
    components.</text>

    <text>on an algorithm for nonlinear minimax approximation
    certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are
    characterize d by properties which permit the application of
    special algorithms, mainly based on the exchange algorithms of
    remes (1934, 1935), for their solution. in this paper the
    application to problems of this type of a general nonlinear
    algorithm due to osborne and watson (1969) is considered.
    examples are given to illustrate that this algorithm can give
    satisfactory results and, in particular, can successfully solve
    problems which lead to difficulties with the more conventional
    specialist method. march, 1970 watson, g. a. minimax

    consists of a program accessible register containing the miss

    <text>the best books for the libraries. the search for reserves
    is vital. 300 replies to a questionnaire on acquisitioning in
    bibliotekar' (moscow) (1) 1981 were received: 200 from
    municipal libraries, 100 from rural ones. 54% of libraries
    mentioned library suppliers' unsatisfactory management of
    allocations; 90% mentioned poor fulfillment of orders. library
    suppliers' greatest deficiencies were in supplying fiction and
    children's literature, followed by history, technology, art,
    agriculture, medicine, natural history, popular science, sport,
    literature, ethics and law, education, domestic science.
    libraries in new towns have acute acquisitioning problems.
    school libraries should acquisition centrally through library
    suppliers. correspondents suggested more books ought to be sent

    of the new technology; the increasing importance of information
    skills, particularly those associated with computerised
    information retrieval; and the increasing importance of
    collection development and the associated arts of book

    <text>some effects of the 6600 computer on language structures*
    the problem of compiling efficient 6600 codes prompted the
    development of an intermediate language reflecting the
    structure of the machine, that is more easily manipulated in
    improving object program efficiency. the subject of this paper
    is the intermediate language and methods of manipulating it.
    compilations of a series of arithmetic statements are
    discussed. it is assumed that all functions and exponentials
    have been removed from these statements, and replaced by simple
    variables. for purposes of simplicity the treatment of
    subscripts is ignored. a simplified 6600 structure is presented
    to illustrate the compiling method. several assumptions are
    made for purposes of simplification, although there are cases
    in which the assumptions are violated in the actual machine.

    <text>rudolph focke and the theory of the classified catalog.
    between 1900 and 1905, rudolph focke published a series of
    papers on classification theory and a draft of code for the
    construction of classified catalogues. his work was the direct
    result of the reform of librarianship during the last decades
    of the 19th century. the large number of classification systems
    used by german university and research libraries was seen as an
    obstacle to the development of national systems of
    bibliographic control and access. the hope of standardisation
    came to nothing; focke's code may even have had the opposite
    effect of perpetuating local systems well into the 20th
    century. his work was introduced to librarians in the usa at a
    time when subject cataloguing and classification were in
    transition. his code is consistent with the general principles
    underlying the library of congress classification, which may
    have been more influenced by 19th century german classification
    than has hertofore been recognised. re port not available from

    <text>indexing exhaustivity and the computation of similarity
    matrices. some of the automatic classification procedures used
    in information retrieval derive clusters of documents from an
    intermediate similarity matrix, the computation of which
    involves comparing each of the documents in the collection with
    all of the others. it has recently been suggested that many of
    these comparisons, specifically those between documents having
    no terms in common, may be avoided by means of the use of an
    inverted file to the document collection. it is shown that the
    approach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument
    comparisons only if the documents are each indexed by a limited
    number of indexing terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many
    document pairs will be compared several times over and the
    computation will be greater than when conventional approaches
    are used to generate the similarity matrix.</text>

    <text>sorting by replacement selecting in sorting by

    beginning with the i-th element (i&gt;1) is proved to be 2f, in
    accordance with a conjecture of e. h. friend, where f is the
    number of memory cells used. the expected length of the j-th
    sequence is determined to be f times a j-th degree polynomial
    in e, such that the value of this polynomial approaches 2 as j
    approaches infinity. recursive formulas are obtained for both
    the mean and the standard deviation of the length of the j-th
    sequence. the mathematical proofs of these results are based
    upon the assumption that n, the number of items to be sorted,
    is infinite, but it is shown that the error due to the
    finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly as n increases.

    newcastle-upon-tyne polytechnic's travelling workshops

    envisaged for the internal and external components of the
    evaluation became blurred and there was conflict between
    pressures for a traditional, tightly-controlled evaluation and
    the researchers' preference for a more explanatory evaluation
    strategy. illuminative evaluation was used; this eschews pre-
    and post-testing in favour of a wide-ranging study of the
    contextual determinants of a venture's success. its use poses
    many problems because it is a broad strategy rather than a set

    <text>foreign economic literature and its information value.
    foreign economic literature available in bulgarian libraries is
    usually classified as non-marxist publications issued before
    1900. between 1900-45 only a few marxist publications can be
    traced. after world war ii, however, the share of economic
    literature based on marxism increased rapidly. the cyril and
    methodius national library has the largest collection of
    foreign economic literature in the country consisting mainly of
    reference material. the main topic at the university of sofia
    library is economic history and some unique publications can be
    found there, for example from the early days of the soviet
    union. economic theory is represented above all at the library
    of the bulgarian academy of sciences. economic colleges in
    varna and sviscov cater for the needs of their students. there
    are also some specialised collections and catalogues at the
    bulgarian chamber of commerce and the central agricultural
    library, established some time ag o. the majority of foreign
    economic literature is in russian, english, german and french.
    advocates the increased exploitation of all the national
    resources listed above.</text>

    based on analysis of traces of program executions. the concept
    of a register life is in troduced, and used to answer questions
    like: how many registers are used simultaneously? how many
    would be sufficient all of the time? most of the time? what
    would the overhead be if the number of registers were reduced?
    what are registers used for during their lives? the paper also
    discusses the problem of detecting desirable but non-existing
    instructions. other problems are briefly discussed.

    <text>the 75th anniversary of the swiss social science archive.
    the swiss social science archive collects all swiss material
    and much from abroad on social problems and social science.
    stocks include 80,000 books, 600,000 newspaper cuttings and a
    pamphlet collection of 500,000 items. the archive has a keyword
    index of 350 terms; udc was used until 1959, when the archive
    invented its own decimal classification to provide more
    specialised coverage. it is sometimes hard to obtain the
    necessary non-commercial material but the archive receives many
    gifts of private collections. the archive has 12 staff and an
    annual budget of 900,000 fr, including contributions from the
    town and canton of zurich and from the federal government.
    swiss social science documentation has an important centre here
    and is being improved through the archive's work with other
    documentation centres.</text>

    <text>hydra: the kernel of a multiprocessor operating system
    this paper describes the design philosophy of hydra-the kernel
    of an operating system for c.mmp, the carnegie-mellon
    multi-mini-processor. this philosophy is realized through the
    introduction of a generalized notion of "resource", both
    physical and virtual, called an "object". mechanisms are
    presented for dealing with objects, including the creation of
    new types, specification of new operations applicable to a
    given type, sharing, and protection of any reference to a given
    object against improper application of any of the operations
    defined with respect to that type of object. the mechanisms
    provide a coherent basis for extension of the system in two
    directions: the introduction of new facilities, and the
    creation of highly secure systems. june, 1974 wulf, w. cohen,

    <text>graph coloring conditions for the existence of solutions
    to the timetable problem a necessary and sufficient condition
    is presented for the existence of a solution to the gotlieb
    class-teacher timetable problem. several relationships are
    established between the class-teacher timetable problem and
    graphs with preconditions. these preconditions place additional
    restrictions on the coloration of a graph. the preconditions
    correspond to the unavailability constraints and preassigned
    meetings in the class-teacher timetable problem. using some
    recent results that convert graphs with preconditions to graphs
    without them, it is shown that the existence of a coloration of
    a graph is the required necessary and sufficient condition.

    <text>some legal implications of the use of computers in the
    banking business the introduction of computers in to the
    banking business has a wide variety of legal implications that
    merit careful attention at this very early stage. the industry
    is highly regulated by government and, hence, is subject to
    many statutes and regulations. it also is affected by important
    common law rules established by courts. the legal ramifications
    involve not only the mechanization itself, but also the very
    significant, economically attractive phenomenon of off premises
    processing. it is essential to identify and provide for many
    legal aspects right now, before systems and practices
    crystallize, in order to avoid the later impact of
    unanticipated physical complications and expense. the legal
    aspects of computerization in the banking business are
    especially diverse. in some states, there might be the basic
    question whether banks are authorized by law to invest in the
    new facilities, either directly or through cooperatives. more
    challenging are questions relating to off-premises processors,
    particularly with respect to the obligation not to disclose
    information concerning a bank's customers, the adequacy of
    fidelity bond coverage, the extent of liability for improper
    refusal to pay a check, and susceptibility to regulation by
    government agencies. also pertinent is the propriety of data
    processing by banks for nonbank entities and particularly of
    the rendering of that service without charge for bank
    depositors. december, 1963 freed, r. n. ca631204 jb march 13,

    <text>applying h.a. simon's model of limited rationality to
    scientific research and communication. a great number of
    specialist and non-specialist questions are asked about
    scientific research, concerning objectives, methods, results,
    organisation, policies and information sources. such questions
    can be collected and analysed for common denominators but
    recent work by andrews and his collaborators (1979) indicates
    this approach to be inadequate. uses simon's concept of limited
    rationality as a general model of individual and organisational
    operation, which is applied as an analytical framework for
    investigating research activities. the model does help in
    explanation of observations frequently made about research
    behaviour patterns' preference for informal information sources
    and personal contacts, and the formation of informal groups and
    networks. researchers and their organisations would appear to
    function within the boundaries of limited rationality. this
    model can also be used to predict pote ntial problems in
    scientific communication, such as the conception and use of
    thesauri and data banks. the quality of such information
    sources is crucial to the future of scientific research, hence
    the importance of understanding research behaviour.</text>

    <text>political literature in libraries of the ruse region.
    from 1974-79, sections of political literature in 312 selected
    public, trade union and school libraries in the ruse region
    were the subject of a comprehensive investigation. 2,018
    readers completed questionnaires and 191 were interviewed. the
    proportion of political literature in the total book
    collections is on average 20%. the people who study political
    literature are predominantly students or pupils. regrettably,
    only 31.7% of the readers used libraries as a source of
    information for their necessary literature. mass media and
    educational establishments play a much greater part in this
    respect. the desirable turnover of political literature, the
    optimum number of copies, and the discarding of obsolete books
    are also covered. on the whole, the library service is
    performing a valuable role in political education, but even so,
    there is little room for complacency.</text>

    <text>can programming be liberated from the von neumann style?
    a functional style and its algebra of programs conventional
    programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not
    stronger. inherent defects at the most basic level cause them
    to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style
    of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the von
    neumann computer, their close coupling off semantics to state
    transitions, their division of programming into a world of
    expressions and a world of statements, their inability to
    effectively use powerful combining forms for building new
    programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful
    mathematical properties for reasoning about programs. an
    alternative functional style of programming is founded on the
    use of combining forms for creating programs. functional
    programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and
    nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their
    arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of
    procedure declarations to become generally applicable.
    combining forms can use high level programs to build still
    higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional
    languages. associated with the functional style of programming
    is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs
    and whose operations are combining forms. this algebra can be
    used to transform programs and to solve equations whose
    "unknowns" are programs in much the same way one transforms
    equations in high school algebra. these transformations are
    given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same
    language in which programs are written. combining forms are
    chosen not only for their programming power but also for the
    power of their associated algebraic laws. general theorems of
    of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination
    conditions for large classes of programs. a new class of
    computing systems uses the functional programming style both in
    its programming language and in its state transition rules.
    unlike von neumann languages, these systems have semantics
    loosely coupled to states-only one state transition occurs per
    major computation. august, 1978 backus, j. functional

    ... x mn where mi's are matrices. the order in which the
    matrices are computed affects the number of operations. a
    sufficient condition about the association of the matrices in
    the optimal order is presented. an o(n) algorithm to find an
    order of computation which takes less than 25 percent longer
    than the optimal time topt is also presented. in most cases,
    the algorithm yields the optimal order or an order which takes
    only a few percent longer than topt (less than 1 percent on the
    average). july, 1978 chin, f.y. approximate algorithm,

    the increasing evidence of a more flexible attitude on the part
    of libraries to the use of their facilities by children during
    the past 2 decades, there is still a perception on the part of
    some children and their parents that libraries are somehow
    inimical to their way of life. highlights the need for library
    services to develop in ways appropriate to the meeting of the
    needs of the 20th century child, and considers the significance
    of the international year of the child for public library

    however, inadequate coverage of a number of topics and the use
    of specialised terminology make the work unsuitable for use as

    <text>three criteria for designing computing systems to

    adopt explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting proposed
    system features. three possible criteria of this kind are input
    recordability, input specifiability, and asynchronous
    reproducibility of output. these criteria imply that a user
    can, if he desires, either know or control all the influences
    affecting the content and extent of his computer's output. to
    define the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
    machine of a programming language and the notion of a virtual
    computer are explained. examples of applications of the
    criteria concern the reading of a time-of-day clock, the

    literature on a problem; the road to science starts in the
    library. the university course on students' educational
    research work inculcates the reading habit, independent work
    with books. for best results students should abstract the
    important parts of their reading, thinking it over unhurriedly.
    creative interaction with the text is most important. after
    lectures, the next stage is the library, following up points
    made in the lectures. tactful librarians help readers choose a
    book at their level of competence and, in a short conversation,
    can arouse strong interest in a book or, conversely, switch a
    reader over to an alternative choice.</text>

    <text>libraries and networks in transition: problems and
    prospects for the 1980's. librarians have learnt that
    automation is more difficult and will take longer than
    originally thought; some functions are better carried out
    through networks; although computer-based systems are more
    powerful and more versatile than the manual systems they
    replace, they can also be more expensive to operate and
    maintain (at least during the transition period); and
    computerisation imposes much higher standards of accuracy on
    library operations. discusses problems and prospects for
    libraries and networks during the next decade and suggests that
    the research libraries group, inc. (a growing partnership of 25
    libraries trying to collectively maintain and expand their
    capabilities using new technology even in the face of
    diminishing resources) could serve as a model and inspiration
    for other groups worldwide.</text>

    <text>the chinese library and information scene' reflections on
    a visit to china in june 80. impressions gained during an
    official visit to china in june 80. china has a few very large
    libraries with strong collections and generous funding. many
    other libraries have serious gaps in their collections as a
    result of the cultural revolution. the emphasis is on academic
    and research libraries-there seem to be no public libraries.
    services are undeveloped, buildings and equipment are not of a
    high quality, there is no planned interlending system or
    library coordination, and most research is concerned with
    automation and information systems rather than librarianship.
    the chinese wish to solve their problems themselves, although
    they welcome help. the whole situation is in a state of rapid
    change and development.</text>

    <text>cost-effectiveness of soviet serial exchanges. while the

    at duke university library suggests that this may no longer be

    through normal trade channels has increased in recent years.
    because of this fact, the importance of maintaining equitable

    shown that it should not be assumed that such exchanges are
    equitable. regular reviews are recommended to serve the needs
    of libraries best.</text>

    <text>spline function methods for nonlinear boundary-value
    problems the solution of the nonlinear differential equation
    y"=f(x,y,y') with two-point boundary conditions is approximated
    by a quintic or cubic spline function y(x). the method is well
    suited to nonuniform mesh size and dynamic mesh size
    allocation. for uniform mesh size h, the error in the quintic
    spline y(x) is o(h^4), with typical error one-third that from
    numerov's method. requiring the differential equation to be
    satisfied at the mesh points results in a set of difference
    equations, which are block tridiagonal and so are easily solved
    by relaxation or other standard methods. june, 1969 blue, j. l.

    <text>computing polynomial resultants: bezout's determinant vs.
    collins' reduced p.r.s. algorithm algorithms for computing the
    resultant of two polynomials in several variables, a key
    repetitive step of computation in solving systems of polynomial
    equations by elimination, are studied. determining the best
    algorithm for computer implementation depends upon the extent
    to which extraneous factors are introduced, the extent of
    propagation of errors caused by truncation of real
    coefficients, memory requirements, and computing speed.
    preliminary considerations narrow the choice of the best
    algorithm to bezout's determinant and collins' reduced
    polynomial remainder sequence (p.r.s.) algorithm. detailed
    tests performed on sample problems conclusively show that
    bezout's determinant is superior in all respects except for
    univariate polynomials, in which case collins' reduced p.r.s.
    algorithm is somewhat faster. in particular bezout's
    determinant proves to be strikingly superior in numerical
    accuracy, displaying excellent stability with regard to
    round-off errors. results of tests are reported in detail.

    collects statistical information for regulation, programme

    moreover, it goes on to cover the additional control problems
    of handling material such as off line encrypted data or

    transparency in which the normal character structure or

    libraries), which has overall control of the parish libraries,
    providing advice, organising conferences and compiling
    statistics. a library school was founded which had to close in
    the 1970s through lack of funds. the parish libraries are
    staffed mainly by volunteers, for whom short training courses

    <text>the choice of reference poin ts in best-match file
    searching improvements to the exhaustive search method of
    best-match file searching have previously been achieved by
    doing a preprocessing step involving the calculation of
    distances from a reference poin t. this paper discusses the
    proper choice of reference poin ts and extends the previous
    algorithm to use more than one reference poin t. it is shown
    that reference poin ts should be located outside of data
    clusters. the results of computer simulations are presented
    which show that large improvements can be achieved by the
    proper choice and location of multiple reference poin ts. may,

    <text>library education in canada. outlines the development of

    canadian library schools still submit their programmes to the
    american library association for accreditation. however anyone
    can call himself a 'professional librarian' and libraries do
    not have to hire graduates from accredited schools. most
    programmes run for 2 years for a master's degree, the 1st year
    full time and the 2nd part time. schools have recently oriented
    their programmes away from training in routine techniques and
    towards education for planning, administration, the setting of
    standards, organising political activity for library support,
    deployment of human and material resources, fund-raising and
    new methods of bibliographic and subject analysis.</text>

    <text>consecutive storage of relevant records with redundancy
    this paper studies the properties of a new class of file
    organizations (crwr) where records relevant to every query are
    stored in consecutive storage locations but the organizations
    contain redundancy. some theorems which provide tools for
    reducing redundancy in crwr organizations have been also
    developed. redundancies obtained by the application of these
    theorems are compared with that of query-inverted file
    organizations. some crwr organization with minimum redundancy
    have also been developed for queries which specify sets of
    keys. august, 1975 ghosh, s. p. consecutive, retrieval,

    <text>algebraic simplification: a guide for the perplexed
    algebraic simplification is examined first from the point of
    view of a user who needs to comprehend a large expression, and
    second from the point of view of a designer who wants to
    construct a useful and efficient system. first we describe
    various techniques akin to substitution. these techniques can
    be used to decrease thesize of an expression and make it more
    intelligible to a user. then we delineate the spectrum of
    approaches to the design of automatic simplification
    capabilities in an algebraic manipulation system. systems are
    divided into five types. each type provides different
    facilities for the manipulation and simplification of
    expressions. finally we discuss some of the theoretical results
    related to algebraic simplification. we describe several
    positive results about the existence of powerful simplification
    algorithms and the number-theoretic conjectures on which they
    rely. results about the nonexistence of algorithms for certain
    classes of expressions are included. august, 1971 moses, j.

    <text>high-level data flow analysis in contrast to the
    predominant use of low-level in termediate text, high-level
    data flow analysis deals with programs essentially at source
    level and exploits the control flow information implicit in the
    parse tree. the need for high-level flow analysis arises from
    several aspects of recent work on advanced methods of program
    certification and optimization. this paper proposes a simple
    general method of high-level data flow analysis that allows
    free use of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs
    when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of data
    flow information to reflect program changes, and derives new
    global information helpful in solving many familiar global flow
    analysis problems. an illustrative application to live variable
    analysis is presented. many of the graphs involved are
    constructed and analyzed before any programs are compiled, thus
    avoiding certain costs that low-level methods incur repeatedly
    at compile time. october, 1977 rosen, b. k. data flow analysis,

    <text>on the edge of the desert' statement of achievements by

    loans and stocks conceal weaknesses within a library and the
    unfulfilled wishes of readers. there is no prospect at present
    of a library law and salary negotiations have stopped. only 10%
    of the population use libraries' more dedicated librarians are
    needed to develop social librarianship. freedom in book
    selection is often threatened by the attitude of local
    officials and by conditions on the book market. public
    libraries in germany have developed not in a unified fashion
    but through a variety of historical causes. the best cure of

    <text>note on triple-precision floating-point arithmetic with
    132-bit numbers in a recent paper, gregory and raney described
    a technique for double-precision floating-point arithmetic. a
    similar technique can be developed for triple-precision
    floating-point arithmetic and it is the purpose of this note to
    describe this technique. only the multiplication and the
    division algorithms are described, since the
    addition-subtraction algorithm can be obtained by a trivial
    modification of the algorithm in gregory's and raney's paper.

    using a methodological framework derived from recent french
    research in bibliology and documentology, the dialectics of the

    comparing and contrasting the properties of each in relation to
    their essential characteristics; how they function within their
    respective communication circuits; marxist sociological theory;
    and the historical perspective. from this structural analysis
    of the 2 entities a scientific synthesis is effected delimiting
    the relationship between bibliology and documentology, and the
    applications of this theory in the teaching field examined. the
    analytical model employed, and its method of construction, is

    requirements of such systems are a capacity for selecting,
    storing, retrieving and presenting information, high

    <text>local and regional collections. text of a 1978 conference
    paper discussing organisation and management policies.
    considers firstly the materials constituting a local collection
    in relation to geographical relevance and criteria for
    selection' works by local authors, produced by local printers,
    or dealing with local subjects, are considered, as well as
    official administrative publications and ephemera. then
    problems of exploitation and conservation are examined, in an
    attempt to reconcile archival responsibilities with user needs'
    the range of potential users, from scholarly researchers to
    interested non-specialists, is discussed in relation to
    preparation of bibliographical tools permitting multiple access
    to the collection to cater for varied approaches; basic
    commonsense precautions are suggested for minimising damage to
    book materials, and special measures for minor documents
    proposed. emphasises that each librarian must evolve his own
    policy to meet his own particular situation.</text>

    <text>on obtaining correct input:a new approach most
    information put into machine readable form, whether from
    scientific or business origins, is still keypunched. this paper
    is addressed toward the difficulty of obtaining correctly
    keypunched and key verified data and an alternative method is
    suggested in which the computer itself is used to rule out the
    possibility of errors in input. this technique is explained and
    illustrated by reference to a working program which involves
    essentially two phases: in the first phase errors are detected
    by the machine, and subsequently, in the second phase, they are
    corrected by it. july, 1969 kennedy, m. correct data, correct

    <text>when the readers don't come' an attempt at integrating
    the library into an area of urban renewal. the st. pauli
    district of hamburg is a socially underprivileged area where
    slum clearance is taking place. in 1980, library stocks
    totalled 20,000 volumes of which 800 are turkish literature
    provided for the many foreign residents; there are also games
    and german and turkish cassettes. the book turnover is below
    the average for hamburg libraries. since many adult residents
    either understood little german or are confused by the
    library's technical procedures, few of them use the library.
    local children tend to use the library as a meeting-place,
    which causes noise but does provide somewhere to play. the
    librarian, moving away from purely traditional librarianship,
    works closely with local social workers, visiting families to
    discuss problems and allowing them to use the library for
    meetings; this helps to integrate the library into the
    community.</text>

    <text>interarrival statistics for time sharing systems the

    description of the stochastic processes governing the user
    inputs and the program activity. this paper provides a
    statistical description of the user input process in the
    sdc-arpa general-purpose time-sharing system (tss). the input
    process is assumed to be stationary, and to be defined by the
    interarrival time distribution. the data obtained appear to
    justify satisfactorily the common assumption that the
    interarrival times are serially independent. the data do not
    appear to justify, except as a very rough approximation, the
    usual assumption off an exponential distribution for
    interarrival time. a much more satisfactory approximation to
    the data can be obtained with a biphase or triphase
    hyperexponential distribution. july, 1966 coffman, e. g. wood,

    analyses the possibility of successfully implementing automated

    covers the role of technology in promoting development; the
    need for and likelihood of cooperation among the caribbean
    states; the probable impact of new technology imported from the
    developed world; and the ability of caribbean libraries to
    implement automated programmes and adapt to them. concludes
    that the oclc type network model is not suitable for the

    concrete evidence that the physical, political and social
    obstacles to cooperation could be overcome. recommends instead

    at the education committee meeting of the cities' assembly of
    nrw in duisburg. a total of 18 million books are available in
    public libraries in nrw for a population of 17 million. this
    does not compare well with figures of 5, 6 or even 8-10 books
    per head of population in other european countries. the target
    for public libraries in nrw is 2 books per head but even this
    figure will be difficult to achieve in the face of rising book
    costs and a static acquisition budget. although there are
    several new central libraries in the larger towns the library
    service is unevenly distributed and hardly exists at all in
    some country areas. the librarians have put forward suggestions
    for a library law aimed at improving the situation to the

    <text>what do students read in public libraries?. lecture given

    libraries and large municipal libraries in essen, june 81.
    university students turn 1st to the university library for the
    books they need but they also form a large reader group in the
    public library of a university town. recent surveys made in
    cologne and bochum reveal that the public library has a double
    function for students, covering both general and specialised
    literature demands. the students show great interest in social
    sciences and mathematics and their interest in science and
    technology equals that of the rest of the general public. they
    borrow less fiction than other readers, although they do
    usually demand works of high literary quality and they are
    attracted by branch library stocks as well as by those in
    central libraries.</text>

    there are today 500 factory libraries with specially appointed

    history of workplace libraries, beginning with eugene varlin's
    library opened in 1852. from 1870-1914, libraries became
    attached to the labour exchanges. the largest library today is
    at the renault factory outside paris, with 25,000 employees, of
    whom 1/3 are immigrants. the modern history of factory
    libraries begins here, with the opening of the main library in
    1950 after factory committees had been appointed. the main
    library has 60,000 volumes and employs 5 librarians.

    depending on parameters, with particular emphasis on the

    upper bound, p=k, is derived for the order of accuracy of
    a(inf)-stable formulas. three criteria are given for
    a(0)-stability. it is shown that (1) for p=k, k arbitrary,
    a(inf)-stability implies certain necessary conditions for
    a(0)-stability and for strict stability (meaning that the
    extraneous roots of p(psi) satisfy |psi|&lt;1); (2) for
    p=k=2,3,4,and 5, a(inf)-stability (for k=5 together with
    another constraint) implies strict stability; and (3) for
    certain one-parameter classes of formulas with p=k=3,4,and/or

    reference to a nordinfo course attended in helsinki. defines
    bibliometrics as quantitative measurement of library
    techniques. bibliometric methods can be used on a global scale,
    but they can also be a tool to calculate the best use of an
    individual library's resources. among the empirical laws
    developed, bradford's law is the most applicable. describes the
    use of this law to obtain a graph with an exponentially
    increasing part, a so-called bradford graph. this can show the
    relationship between authors and number of articles, articles
    and quotations and can help to determine the process of
    obsolescence of literature in a library. other bibliometric
    laws are those of lotka and zipf. the methods are useful in
    acquisition, planning of space allocation, withdrawals, library
    use, and other areas of library administration.</text>

    <text>the eschenbach drum scheme the prime function of a drum,
    operating in real time, is to perform accesses quickly. the
    usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate
    engineering or hardware improvements. in this paper the problem
    is attacked not by changing the drum, but rather by modifying
    the manner in which it operates. at the outset, a drum is given
    a functional definition. then a simple design scheme
    (eschenbach) is introduced which enormously increases the rate
    of accessing for drums so defined. this is shown to enable a
    system to perform a job by employing fewer or less expensive
    drums. it is suggested that although the design scheme has a
    specific use, the method underlying it has more general
    applicability. the question of the efficacy of the drum scheme
    is then raised. to deal with this, a standard of efficiency is
    developed in light of realistic real-time circumstances. the
    drum scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits it to be
    analyzed as a problem in queueing theory. thus one is enabled
    to ascertain whether the drum scheme is efficient enough for
    its application. again, whereas the analysis of the drum scheme
    has a specific use, the methods underlying it have more general
    applicability. july, 1966 weingarten, a. ca660706 jb march 2,

    <text>training and education of library instruction librarians.
    contribution to a thematic issue on library use instruction.
    discusses the development of the bibliographic instruction (bi)
    movement in us libraries, and describes the thrust of the bi
    education effort over the past decade as it emanates from
    continuing education. reviews briefly the contribution of ala
    related bibliographic programmes to the development of the
    bibliographic instruction concept. considers some reasons for
    the resistance of library schools to adding courses that would
    train prospective teachers for bibliographic instruction, and
    expresses the hope that recognition of the need for formal
    training for the teaching librarian or the teacher of
    bibliography will strengthen the role of the library in the

    <text>is automation necessary?. in the netherlands supporters
    of the introduction of automated systems in library service
    point to the computerised loans systems already in operation in
    libraries in rotterdam, amsterdam and elsewhere, and to the
    growing number of libraries making use of computerised
    cataloguing networks. opponents of automation point to the
    social implications of the replacement of man by machines. a
    further group suggests that the use of automation in libraries
    depends on the nature of the work to be done and asserts that
    certain technical aids, such as the telephone and the
    photocopier, are regarded as essential to a library's services.
    in spite of unemployment it is becoming increasingly difficult
    to attract and retain staff for certain tasks in libraries. in
    such cases automation can be of great assistance.</text>

    allows an improvement in search speed directly related to the

    <text>ethernet: distributed packet switching for local computer

    for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed

    ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as
    either local computer networks or loosely coupled
    multiprocessors. an ethernet's shared communication facility,
    its ether, is a passive broadcast medium with no central
    control. coordination of access to the ether for packet
    broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting
    stations using controlled statistical arbitration. switching of
    packets to their destinations on the ether is distributed among
    the receiving stations using packet address recognition. design
    principles and implementation are described, based on
    experience with an operating ethernet of 100 nodes along a
    kilometer of coaxial cable. a model for estimating performance
    under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled
    communication are included for completeness. july, 1976

    <text>the undergraduate library: lamont and the american
    experience. this review of the literature on undergraduate
    libraries, the historical context from which they arose, and
    their status at the end of the 70s points out that a long
    tradition of lack of concern for undergraduate bibliographical
    needs was broken dramatically in 1949 by the construction of
    lamont library, the harvard undergraduate facility. although
    designed to solve problems unique to harvard, lamont was an
    exemplary construction that soon captured the imagination of
    the academic library world. it became the model for a rash of
    new libraries aimed at satisfying 'unique' undergraduate needs.
    these libraries proliferated during the 50s and 60s, a period
    of accelerated growth in academe. by the 70s, however, the
    general financial retrenchment of american colleges and
    universities had virtually halted new construction. further,
    the thesis that presumed the needs of undergraduates to be
    somehow 'different', as well as the advisabi lity of facilities
    effectively segregating them from the rest of the academic
    community, came under attack in the professional literature.
    few undergraduate libraries were built during this period and
    several were closed or converted to other uses. report not

    test the following hierarchical model' public library use is a
    function of (1) individual characteristics; (2) awareness of
    library services; (3) perceived accessibility of the library;
    (4) perceived ease of use of the library; and (5) use of other
    non-public libraries. the model was tested with 4 different
    library use measures-a dichotomised measure of use and nonuse,
    and, among library users, frequency of use and 2-factor
    analytically derived indexes descriptive of 2 distinctly
    different types of library use. type 1 use appeared to measure
    use intensity; type 2-in-house use. interview data were
    collected from 202 residents of syracuse, new york. results
    indicated that public library users perceived the library as
    more accessible than did nonusers, and use frequency was
    related to awareness of special library programmes, as was
    intensity of use, and in-house use was related to use of other

    <text>competency-based education and library instruction.
    contribution to a thematic issue on library use instruction.
    explains briefly the meaning of competency-based education-an
    educational approach which structures learning around
    competencies defined as fundamental for successful performance,
    and applies the concept to library user education. discusses
    the experiences of the following us educational institutions
    which are involved in competency based programmes' alverno
    college; doane college; sangamon state university; the
    university of louisville; findlay college; and the university
    of wisconsin-parkside. identifies some of the potential
    benefits that can be derived from adopting the competency based
    approach to library instruction, but recognises its
    limitations, and points out that it may be unsuitable for some
    institutions because it is too time consuming and
    demanding.</text>

    <text>future possibilities for productive reading. 3 series of

    connection between the speed of reading and the understanding
    of what is read. results showed that speed and understanding do
    not change in parallel. up to a critical point they follow each
    other; thereafter further increases in speed are accompanied by
    decreases in understanding. this critical point can be used as
    an index of reading ability for any given reader. libraries
    should promote the use of more productive reading to encourage

    <text>wiser from experience: a study of practical work as an
    element of library education. library school courses have for a
    long time included periods of practical work to enable students
    to apply their theoretical training to practical situations in
    libraries. such periods may take the form of 'self-orientation'
    periods, providing the student with all-round experience of
    library techniques or 'experience' periods, during which the
    student may carry out detailed study of a particular topic. in
    the netherlands most library school courses are too short to
    allow students to gain more than a brief view of library
    routines in practice. in addition, students often fail to
    derive the maximum benefit from their practical training
    because of inadequate preparation by the library schools and
    the heavy workload of course tutors. there should be regular
    consultation between student, course-tutor and training library
    to ensure that all aspects of practical training are being
    covered.</text>

    <text>recent improvements in madcap madcap is a programming
    language admitting subscripts, superscripts and certain forms
    of displayed formulas. the basic implementation of this
    language was described in a previous paper [madcap: a
    scientific compiler for a displayed formula textbook language,
    comm. acm 4 (jan. 61), 31-36]. this paper discusses recent
    improvements in the language in three areas: complex display,
    logical control, and subprogramming. in the area of complex
    display, the most prominent improvements are a notation for
    integration and for the binomial coefficients. in the area of
    logical control the chief new feature is a notation for
    variably nested looping. the discussion of subprogramming is
    focused on madcap's notation for and use of "procedures."

    can be transmitted out of context; (4) that information is only

    <text>thesaurus of music classification according to motive,

    need for a definitive thesaurus of music has been recognised
    for many years and various steps have been taken towards a more
    comprehensive method of cataloguing musical content. the german
    library institute (deutsche bibliotheksinstitut (dbi)) has been
    working on a thesaurus of music since 1978. 1 of the greatest
    difficulties in the preparation was deciding which criteria
    were necessary for indexing music titles. work started by
    collecting material and examining each title to see whether it
    contained certain concepts which referred to the content. these
    formed the empiric base for the thesaurus vocabulary. the
    thesaurus will contain 500-600 terms which will be the future
    preferred indexing terms. the project is not yet completed but
    is ready to be tested by the municipal music library in munich
    in the framework of their cataloguing activity.</text>

    <text>some characteristics of sorting in computing systems
    using random access storage devices the substantial differences
    in characteristics of random access storage and tape devices
    dictate that concepts and objectives of computer program design
    be considered from the viewpoint of the external file medium
    used. this is particularly true in the case of sorting. in a
    tape-oriented system, the major sorting problem is that of
    minimizing merge time despite the limited orders of merge
    possible. in contrast, sorting in a random access-oriented
    system encourages the selection of the optimum order of merge
    from many possible orders. the latter problem is discussed in
    this paper, along with criteria developed for determining the
    optimum order of merge according to the various properties of
    random access storage devices. attention is also given to the
    problem of key sorting versus record sorting and the possibly
    serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system.

    <text>functional information design' research and practice.
    although functional objectives have concerned designers for
    many years, and psychologists have published research on issues
    related to graphic design, fruitful cooperation between the 2
    specialisms has only rarely been achieved. suggests that the
    traditional objectives and methods of neither group are
    sufficiently oriented towards the communication of information
    in a complex society. a user-centred approach is urged, drawing
    from both the intuitive problem-solving skills of designers and
    the methodologies of psychologists.</text>

    <text>some new methods of detecting step edges in digital
    pictures this note describes two operators that respond to step
    edges, but not to ramps. the first is similar to the digital
    laplacian, but uses the max, rather than the sum, of the x and
    y second differences. the second uses the difference between
    the mean and median gray levels in a neighborhood. the outputs
    obtained from these operators applied to a set of test pictures
    are compared with each other and with the standard digital
    laplacian and gradient. a third operator, which uses the
    distance between the center and centroid of a neighborhood as
    an edge value, is also briefly considered; it turns out to be
    equivalent to one of the standard digital approximations to the
    gradient. february,1978 schachter, b.j. rosenfeld, a. image

    <text>cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems a
    cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard type
    interconnection of identical modules (or cells), where each
    cell contains a few bits of memory and a small amount of
    combinational logic, and communicates mainly with its immediate
    neighbors in the array. the chief computational advantage
    offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed achieved
    by virtue of the possibilities for parallel processing. in this
    paper it is shown that cellular arrays are inherently well
    suited for the solution of many graph problems. for example,
    the adjacency matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array;
    each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array, and
    typical row and column operations are readily implemented by
    simple cell logic. a major challenge in the effective use of
    cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems is the
    determination of algorithms that exploit the possibilities for
    parallelism, especially for problems whose solutions appear to
    be inherently serial. in particular, several parallelized
    algorithms are presented for the solution of certain spanning
    tree, distance, and path problems, with direct applications to
    wire routing, pert chart analysis, and the analysis of many
    types of networks. these algorithms exhibit a computation time
    that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, where
    n is the number of nodes in the graph. straightforward cellular
    implementations of the well-known serial algorithms for these
    problems require about n steps, and noncellular implementations
    require from n^2 to n^3 steps. september, 1972 levitt, k. n.

    <text>a comparison of list-processing computer languages
    (including a detailed comparison of comit, ipl-v, lisp 1.5, and
    slip) a detailed comparison is presented of comit, ipl-v, lisp
    1.5 and slip - four well-known computer programming languages
    which, among them, exhibit all the principal characteristics of
    existing list-processing languages. important common features
    of list-processing languages are reviewed: forms of data
    structures which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic
    allocation of storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of
    recursive operations. principal differences between the four
    languages under consideration are detailed: representations of
    data, both by the programmer and within the machine; methods
    for storage allocation; programming formalisms and special
    processes available, including arithmetic facilities; and
    usability in terms of availability, documentation, learning
    aids and debugging facilities. a rough comparison shows that
    all the languages discussed have approximately the same speed.
    finally, the authors give some heuristics to aid in the
    selection of one of these languages for use in particular
    problem applications, concluding that no one of the languages
    considered is distinctly superior in all possible
    list-processing applications. april, 1964 bobrow, d. g.

    basically two approaches: the binomial theorem and the

    <text>continuing education of librarians through private study.
    report on a 2-year-scheme introduced by the central regional

    librarians in the region through private study. initially, 75
    topics were offered, and 94% of full-time librarians took part
    in the scheme. even professional librarians with 10, 15 and
    more years of service were not excluded from theoretical,
    controversial and/or innovative themes. they also widely
    explored soviet periodicals and literature in russian. the
    attitude and response of beginners and some library assistants
    appeared to be less enterprising and enthusiastic, in some
    cases even formal. it is hoped, however, that their
    professional ethics will improve in future. regular meetings

    library in sofia, its director emphasises the importance of
    information obtained through books, especially in the field of
    science and technology, for the country's progress. although
    the information needs of a small country like bulgaria are
    almost the same as those of the large country, the former must
    be much more selective and carefully budgeted because of its
    limited financial resources in general, and particularly in
    foreign currencies. the national library's book collection is
    in fact, open to the whole country by means of interlending. it
    has the main responsibility for publishing the bulgarian
    national bibliography, computerisation of which has gradually
    been introduced. extension of the present building,
    construction of a depository library together with overall new
    investment will allow the library to meet the incr easing

    <text>application of game tree searching techniques to
    sequential pattern recognition a sequential pattern recognition
    (spr) procedure does not test all the features of a pattern at
    once. instead, it selects a feature to be tested. after
    receiving the result of that test, the procedure either
    classifies the unknown pattern or selects another feature to be
    tested, etc. medical diagnosis is an example of spr. in this
    paper the authors suggest that spr be viewed as a one-person
    game played against nature (chance). virtually all the powerful
    techniques developed for searching two-person, strictly
    competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either
    directly or by analogy into spr procedures. in particular, one
    can incorporate the "mini average backing-up procedure" and the
    "gamma procedure," which are the analogues of the "minimax
    backing-up procedure" and the "alpha-beta procedure,"
    respectively. some computer simulated experiments in character
    recognition are presented. the results indicate that the
    approach is promising. february, 1971 slagle, j. r. lee, r. c.

    not only criticism of the western library theories but also
    appreciation of practical achievements. inconsistency of theory
    (non-political orientation of libraries) with practice (middle
    class bias of public libraries) was 1 of the main areas of
    criticism in the 1940s and 1950s. 1960s brought wider interest
    in special librarianship and problems encountered in various

    and artificial lighting, as well as the biological needs for

    classification system with access to many general and
    specialised catalogues which were not available in such a
    complete and efficient form before; it provides a means of
    locating material of which only fragments of the title are
    known as it is able to combine unspecific pieces of search
    information very rapidly; also it is no longer necessary to
    deal with an increasing number of monthly or quarterly

    staff size and type, collection size and arrangement, and
    methods employed to provide descriptive and subject access to
    federal documents in the depository system. results indicated
    that on the average about 40% of depository items were being
    selected yearly and arranged in some form of separate
    collection. 1 in 4 libraries does not provide any descriptive
    access; less than 6% of the libraries provide some subject
    access. computer technology (particularly in the form of
    on-line bibliographic services) is modestly used; only 1/3 of

    <text>an optimal insertion algorithm for one-sided
    height-balanced binary search trees an algorithm for inserting
    an element into a one-sided height-balanced (oshb) binary
    search tree is presented. the algorithm operates in time o(log
    n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. this represents
    an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion
    algorithms of hirschberg and kosaraju, which require time o(log
    2n). moreover, the o(log n) complexity is optimal. earlier
    results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also
    be performed in o(log n) time. thus the result of this paper
    gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees
    should be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has
    a smaller time complexity than insertion. furthermore, it can
    now be concluded that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in
    oshb trees can be performed in the same time as the
    corresponding operations for the more general avl trees, to
    within a constant factor. however, the insertion and deletion
    algorithms for oshb trees appear much more complicated than the
    corresponding algorithms for avl trees. september, 1979

    <text>the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications
    system a study is made of the way in which asynchronous time
    division multiplexing changes the stochastic nature of the
    arrival process from a user to the computer and, consequently,
    affects the performance of a time-shared
    computer-communications system. it is concluded that while, for
    certain values of system parameters, there is noticeable
    improvement in the performance of the computer (model), in the
    sense that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
    improvements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by
    multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the
    computer-communications system performance. analytical and
    simulation results are based on the model of the
    computer-communications system being an m/d/1 queue (the
    multiplexor) in tandem with a single exponential server (the
    computer). analytical results include a general description of
    the output process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions under
    which this output process is approximately poisson. march, 1973

    inhabitants with 1 mobile and 10 branch libraries. the new
    library will have 1500 sq.m. with room for expansion, making a
    music library possible eventually. interviews the mayor and
    chairman of the union library, who is prepared to allocate more
    money to the service if demand increases. the mobile library
    has been very successful in areas too sparsely populated to
    sustain branches. party politics is fortunately absent among
    politicians dealing with libraries. they must, however, have
    the final responsibility in book selection, while interfering
    as little as possible. interviews the chief librarian. since
    the union, space problems have mounted, and with the new
    library, loans are expected to increase without extra
    allocation for staff. would like to se e another mobile library
    replace some of the branches which have few loans. the mobile
    library has brought new readers to the main library. however,
    the use of 1 of the branches visited was such that a mobile

    library's role in information for developing countries, which
    is not merely a question of statistical economic and social
    documentation, but covers all forms of literary and artistic
    expression. some swedish public libraries have already provided
    facilities for discussing current topics in the field, in
    cooperation with local study groups and sida, the swedish
    organisation for international aid. a seminar for librarians
    was held in summer 77 on kenya and tanzania, and a unesco
    seminar is producing a handbook of practical hints for
    librarians on information regarding developing countries. a

    <text>the principle of the 'free' public library. for various
    reasons it is becoming more and more difficult for public
    libraries to obtain sufficient funds from their authorities, in
    competition with other more essential services. free public
    libraries originated in the uk during the middle of the last
    century, their main function being the uplifting of the
    uneducated. today public libraries mainly concentrate on the
    supplying of light reading matter, especially novels, of which
    the majority are, from a literary point of view, of a dubious
    nature. the arguments used during the last century to defend
    the principle of free services are no longer valid today. the
    functions of the modern public library are neither fully part
    of the world of education nor the world of recreation, with the
    result that its image to the outside world is obscure.
    considers that, although continued financing of public library
    services by the south african government is necessary, no valid
    objection can be found to charg e users for those services
    which are not essential for the aims which the public library
    pursues.</text>

    <text>two years of dealing with swedish publications. describes

    of 200,000 swedish publications per year which it has been
    receiving since it became a deposit library on 1 jan 79. by
    using the list of swedish periodicals some prior cataloguing
    could be done. a plan for distribution of the material
    according to subject to the 7 units which constitute the
    university library was drawn up. after 2 years some publishers
    are still not aware of their duty to deliver, and routines for
    claiming have had to be developed. the monograph copies
    received are intended as regional copies for distribution to
    other institutions within the region, or copies for use within
    the university; a policy of withdrawal was developed, as no
    archival duty exists. problems were caused by the number and
    late delivery of periodicals. handling of leaflets and other
    ephemera has proved most complicated and time consuming, and
    this material remains uncatalogued. the question of its future
    needs urgently to be decided.</text>

    <text>an information-theoretic approach to text searching in
    direct access systems using direct access computer files of
    bibliographic information, an attempt is made to overcome one
    of the problems often associated with information retrieval,
    namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries, the
    greater part of which is used only infrequently. a novel method
    is presented, which maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution.
    this is more suited to implementation on storage devices. this
    method treats text as a string of characters rather than words
    bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that
    their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of
    word types. the members of this subset are then used as index
    keys for retrieval. the rectangular distribution of key
    frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and
    promises considerable cost advantages. june, 1974 barton, i. j.

    inevitability of change, and the complexity of specification of

    process difficult to justify and manage. it is felt that ease

    services: (1) easy accessibility to the information files by
    users unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value of
    service exceeding user costs. these principles serve as guides
    in mechanizing the acm repository. the main features of the
    information system are direct user access via on-line
    teletypewriter console, direct user access to all details of
    the system organization, unrestricted and expandable search
    vocabulary, user access through many facets of document
    indexing, and stochastic search through linked index terms and
    other file relationships. the first contribution to the acm
    repository consisted of 315 documents, relating primarily to
    early research on compilers. these documents have been
    cataloged and indexed and the catalog is scheduled to appear in
    computing reviews. the indexing system is described in detail.

    <text>the scientific journal' current trends and prospects. the
    primary journal has been the most important formal medium for
    the dissemination of scientific information for over 3
    centuries. a number of criticisms can be levelled against it
    viz. the publication process is time consuming and expensive
    while journal proliferation ensures the scattering of related
    information. recent innovations such as computer-aided
    production, microform publication and letter and synopsis
    journals have attempted to overcome these drawbacks.
    alternatives to the traditional journal such as the
    computer-based editorial processing centre and the electronic
    journal have been mooted and are considered viable in the near
    future although it is likely that they will be resisted by the
    scientific community.</text>

    <text>increasing the efficiency of quicksort a method is
    presented for the analysis of various generalizations of
    quicksort. the average asymptotic number of comparisons needed
    is shown to be an log^2(n). a formula is derived expressing a
    in terms of the probability distribution of the "bound" of a
    partition. this formula assumes a particularly simple form for
    a generalization already considered by hoare, namely, choice of
    the bound as median of a random sample. the main contribution
    of this paper is another generalization of quicksort, which
    uses a bounding interval instead of a single element as bound.
    this generalization turns out to be easy to implement in a
    computer program. a numerical approximation shows that a =
    1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with 1.386 for the
    original. this implies a decrease in number of comparisons of
    18 percent; actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in
    computing time. september, 1970 van emden, m. h. sorting,

    <text>optimum tape-writing procedures consider a magnetic tape
    system with a read check after writing. where an error occurs
    in writing a record, a programmed error routine may either
    bypass some or all of the area on tape or try to rewrite the
    record on the same area. this paper evaluates these two
    procedures on the basis of expected loss of computer time and
    develops a decision rule for selecting the optimum procedure.
    the rule depends critically on the number of times the tape
    being written will be used in the future. in the case where the
    optimum procedure is to bypass an area, a second decision-the
    size of the area to be bypassed-is necessary. a formula is
    developed to determine the optimum area to be bypassed for each

    <text>an efficient, incremental, automatic garbage collector
    this paper describes a new way of solving the storage
    reclamation problem for a system such as lisp that allocates
    storage automatically from a heap, and does not require the
    programmer to give any indication that particular items are no
    longer useful or accessible. a reference count scheme for
    reclaiming non-self-referential structures, and a linearizing,
    compacting, copying scheme to reorganize all storage at the
    users discretion are proposed. the algorithms are designed to
    work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage, and
    large virtual address space. they depend on the fact that most
    cells are referenced exactly once, and that reference counts
    need only be accurate when storage is about to be reclaimed. a
    transaction file stores changes to reference counts, and a
    multiple reference table stores the count for items which are
    referenced more than once. september, 1976 deutsch, l. p.

    <text>permutation enumeration: four new permutation algorithms
    classical permutation enumeration algorithms encounter special
    cases requiring additional computation every nth permutation
    when generating the n! permutations on n marks. four new
    algorithms have the attribute that special cases occur every
    n(n-1)permutations. two of the algorithms produce the next
    permutation with a single exchange of two marks. the other two
    algorithms infrequently exchange more than two marks, but the
    rules for generating the next permutation are very simple.
    performance tests which have counted execution of assignment
    statements, comparisons, arithmetic operations, and subscripted
    array references have shown superiority of the new algorithms
    compared to boothroyd's implementation of m. b. well's

    2nd smallest county, wahkiakum, has, in the last few years,
    gained a library. the nucleus of the collection came from the
    local school, but the library now boasts a book collection,
    paperbacks, interlibrary loan services, a film borrowing
    service, and a reference service. volunteers provide remedial
    reading, tutoring, and instruction in french. the library is
    dependent on donated funds, and fund-raising is an ever present
    chore. volunteer help is erratic and lack of time has prevented
    the librarian from cataloguing the collection. the library
    succeeds, ultimately, through community determination, and,
    operating on the premise that something is better than nothing,
    cares for the individual by providing what is really wanted by

    <text>reentrant polygon clipping a new family of clipping
    algorithms is described. these algorithms are able to clip
    polygons against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three
    dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which lie outside
    the volume. in two dimensions the algorithms permit clipping
    against irregular convex windows. polygons to be clipped are
    represented as an ordered sequence of vertices without
    repetition of first and last, in marked contrast to
    representation as a collection of edges as was heretofore the
    common procedure. output polygons have an identical format,
    with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe any
    newly-cut edge or edges. the algorithms easily handle the
    particularly difficult problem of detecting that a new vertex
    may be required at a corner of the clipping window. the
    algorithms described achieve considerable simplicity by
    clipping separately against each clipping plane or window
    boundary. code capable of clipping the polygon against a single
    boundary is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries.
    each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only two
    vertex values and may begin its processing as soon as the first
    output vertex from the proceeding stage is ready. because the
    same code is reentered for clipping against subsequent
    boundaries, clipping against very complex window shapes is
    practical. for perspective applications in three dimentions, a
    six-plane truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping volume.
    the two additional planes parallel to the projection screen
    serve to limit the range of depth preserved through the
    projection. a perspective projection method which provides for
    arbitrary view angles and depth of field in spite of simple
    fixed clipping planes is described. this method is ideal for
    subsequent hidden-surface computations. january, 1974

    technology is the force advancing change. the adoption of
    technology is seen as desirable and within the libraries' span

    <text>solution of systems of polynomial equations by

    has been coded in lisp and formac and used in solving systems
    of polynomial equations. it is found that the method is very
    effective in the case of small systems, where it yields all
    solutions without the need for initial estimates. the method,
    by itself, appears in appropriate, however, in the solution of
    large systems of equation due to the explosive growth in the
    intermediate equations and the hazards which arise when the
    coefficients are truncated. a comparison is made with
    difficulties found in other problems in non-numerical
    mathematics such as symbolic integration and simplification.

    <text>principles for preserving and restoring library
    collections. the principles for the preservation and
    restoration of library collections are set out by the members
    of the standing committee of ifla's preservation section. the
    aim of the principles is to increase library staff's awareness
    of the necessity of preserving and restoring not only archive
    material but also contemporary literature collections. the most
    important principle is that of suitable storage facilities.
    most common forms of damage occur through unstable climatic
    conditions, incorrect lighting, dust, biological causes
    (micro-organisms and insects) and chemical causes (oxidation
    and hydrolysis of the cellulose). to protect original material,
    copies should be lent to the user whenever possible.
    restoration should only be carried out when it is unavoidable.
    every step of the restoration process should be documented as
    librarians should realise that even expert restoration can lead
    to falsification and distortion of the original .</text>

    <text>combining decision rules in a decision table the
    techniques for minimizing logic circuits are applied to the
    simplification of decision tables by the combining of decision
    rules. this method is logically equivalent to the
    quien-mccluskey method for finding prime implicants. if some of
    the decision rules implied in the else rule occur with low
    frequency, then the else rule can be used to further simplify
    the decision table. several objectives merit consideration in
    optimizing a decision table:(1) reducing machine execution
    time; (2) reducing preprocessing time; (3) reducing required
    machine memory; (4) reducing the number of decision rules.
    (this often improves the clarity of the decision table to a
    human reader.) it will be shown that objectives (3) and (4) can
    be furthered with the above methods. objective (1) is also
    attained if overspecified decision rules are not combined.
    objective (2) must be compared against the potential benefits
    of objectives (1), (3), and (4) in deciding whether to use the
    above methods. august, 1975 shwayder, k. the quine-mccluskey

    school developed and from 1770 also taught forestry science. in
    1808 it became an institute of forestry, and this reflected on
    the contents of the library which expanded to cover new subject
    areas. the institute became the academy of mining and forestry
    in 1846 and only acquired university status in 1934. the
    library development had been hampered by the 1st world war,
    inadequate buildings and lack of staff. with the founding of
    the university a new library was also planned. the new library
    building was opened in 1977. it is the only one of its kind in
    hungary, devoted entirely to specialist literature concerning
    forestry and the timber industry. the library is equipped with
    the latest technical facilities and provides an excellent

    museum service in automating its cataloguing and circulation
    system. the service rejected marc records and created its own
    programmes and files. retrospective catalogue conversion has
    been carried out. the circulation system comprises a plessey
    satellite and operates in batch mode at the county's 6 busiest
    branches each of which has at least 1 issue, discharge and
    composite terminal. the full range of housekeeping reports and
    statistics can be generated. a kwoc index is currently being
    considered to assist with title requests and most of the
    subject queries.</text>

    <text>methods of evaluating polynomial approximations in
    function evaluation routines the method of nested
    multiplication is commonly used in function evaluation routines
    to evaluate approximation polynomials. new polynomial
    evaluation methods have been developed in recent years which
    require fewer multiplications than nested multiplication and
    may therefore be preferable for use in function evaluation
    routines. although some of these methods do not appear to be
    practically useful because of rounding-error difficulties,
    several methods of evaluating low-degree polynomials have been
    found to be satisfactory. three such methods are described and
    illustrated. march, 1967 file, c. t. ca670309 jb february 28,

    <text>public welfare case records' a study of archival

    of individual case files on welfare applicants and recipients,
    which are of great historical value. in 1978 a questionnaire
    was sent to all state archivists to identify current practices
    and principal problems encountered regarding the accessioning
    of public welfare case records. the study was restricted to
    federal-state categorical income maintenance programmes. a 92%
    response rate yielded data on the value of case records as

    studied; and a recognition of the importance of context.
    against this background, outlines some ethnographical

    <text>management-by-objectives applied in a south african
    industrial library. management-by-objectives is suggested as a
    means to justify the existence of an industrial library and
    information service. the prerequisites are that the industrial
    librarian must grasp the special circumstances under which a
    service function operates in industry as well as the attitudes
    towards these functions. he must also acquaint himself with the
    objectives of the organisation he serves and arrange his
    services to make a definable contribution towards the
    achievement of these organisational objectives. the objectives
    of the different departments must be used as premises for
    determining where the library and information function should
    operate and how its services should be presented. the
    information service (which consists of 3 sections, a library,
    translation bureau and information dissemination) of the south
    african iron and steel industrial corporation (iscor) is used
    as a working example. the use of mbo by isc or is briefly
    discussed and the objectives of iscor and its general manager
    are mentioned. from these objectives areas of responsibility
    are derived and identified in the form of the different iscor

    <text>certification of programs for secure information flow
    this paper presents a certification mechanism for verifying the
    secure flow of information through a program. because it
    exploits the properties of a lattice structure among security
    classes, the procedure is sufficiently simple that it can
    easily be included in the analysis phase of most existing
    compilers. appropriate semantics are presented and proved
    correct. an important application is the confinement problem:
    the mechanism can prove that a program cannot cause supposedly
    nonconfidential results to depend on confidential input data.

    <text>video in sweden (part 2). comments on the swedish video
    commission's report, published in 1981. the report discusses
    how video can be used to strengthen freedom of expression.
    quality video from abroad must be available. minority groups
    stand to benefit from video, and domination by commercial
    producers and distributors must be opposed. the report assigns
    a decisive role to public libraries as distribution channels,
    with 'videographers', media workshops and media 'cafes'
    attached to local libraries. it proposes state subsidised
    production with the swedish educational radio, the swedish
    television, and the swedish film institute, among others, as
    producers. distribution through libraries might take 3 forms'
    showing in libraries, loans to individuals and societies, via
    cable to homes and institutions. financing is to be the
    government for the 1st year and by the local authorities
    thereafter, with a possible lending charge. the report's
    thorough survey of the field should prove useful also to the
    other nordic countries. implementation of the proposals is,
    however, uncertain owing to the difficult financial position of
    the public libraries. for part 1, 2see1 the previous

    <text>fast parallel sorting algorithms a parallel bucket-sort
    algorithm is presented that requires time o(log n) and the use
    of n processors. the algorithm makes use of a technique that
    requires more space than the product of processors and time. a
    realistic model is used model is used in which no memory
    contention is permitted. a procedure is also presented to sort
    n numbers in time o(k log n) using n 1 + 1/k processors, for k
    an arbitrary integer. the model of computation for this
    procedure permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory
    location. august, 1978 hirschberg, d.s. parallel processing,

    the minicomputer is used to collect, edit, and correct
    candidate thesaurus terms. the use of the minicomputer eases
    the process of grouping terms into files of similar concepts
    and facilitates the generation of products useful in vocabulary
    review and in term structuring. syndetic relations, indicated
    by assigning coded identification numbers, are altered easily
    in the design phase to reflect restructuring requirements.
    because thesaurus terms are already in machine-readable form,
    it is simple to prepare print programmes to provide permuted,
    alphabetic, hierarchical, and chart formatted term displays.
    overall, the use of the minicomputer facilities initial

    <text>an information algebra - phase i report-language
    structure group of the codasyl development committee this
    report represents the results of the first phase of the work of
    the language structure group. the goal of this work is to
    arrive at a proper structure for a machine-independent
    problem-defining language, at the systems level of data
    processing. the report is based, for the most part, on a
    mathematical model called "an information algebra" developed
    primarily by r. bosak. it is hoped that this report will be
    read (a) with avid interest by programming language designers
    and implementors, and all those interested in developing a
    theoretical approach to data processing; (b) with interest and
    understanding by professional programmers and systems analysts;
    and (c) with appreciation by the businessman-analyst-manager.
    the authors have not attempted an exhaustive discourse in this
    report. rather, they have tried to present a philosophy to the
    professional people who are vitally concerned with providing a
    working language for the systems analyst's use. they trust that
    the ideas in this report will stimulate others to think along
    similar lines. questions and comments will be welcomed, and can
    be addressed to any of the members of the language structure
    group: robert bosak, system development corporation; richard f.
    clippinger, honeywell edp division; carey dobbs, remington rand
    univac division; roy goldfinger (chairman), ibm corporation;

    cost on the condition that the loss of the information is less
