    <text>public music libraries-a statistical point of view. at
    the end of mar 79 the 79/80 rapid statistics concerning public
    libraries in west germany were published. they are published
    annually by the german library institute but from 1982 the
    'deutsche bibliotheksstatistik dbs' will be publishing a
    complete set of statistics. the section concerning public music
    libraries in the current statistics shows that there are 54 of
    them and that 2 more are planned. the statistics concerning
    stock are difficult to evaluate as some libraries now have new
    methods of calculating stock or others have their stock
    included in central libraries. however, taking this into
    consideration there has been an increase in stock of about 2.9%
    and the rate of borrowing has risen by 6.4%. of the 40
    libraries which supplied figures concerning expenditure 1/3 had
    no rise in their budget or even had cuts of between -7% and
    -24%. although the remaining 2/3 had a budget rise the total
    drop in expenditure was 2.1%.</text>

    <text>the cataloguing of music manuscripts in franconia.
    cataloguing of music manuscripts in franconia was begun in 1977
    by the wurzburg university. the catalogue provides lists of
    locations in roman catholic and evangelical parish churches.
    most of the 1,550 roman catholic items are settings of the
    mass; there is little instrumental music apart from some 19th
    century organ pieces. the 600 manuscripts from evangelical
    churches are mostly in the rossach collection, dating from the
    middle of the 18th century. many compositions are by well-known
    composers from outside franconia of the 18th and 19th
    centuries. collections owned by noble families contain mostly
    secular songs, piano and chamber music. most of the manuscripts
    are in good condition; a few suffering from damp required
    laboratory treatment. the printed music documented at the same
    time was mostly from the 19th century.</text>

    reactions of users to precis (preserved context index system)
    subject indexing in british education index were studied by
    structured interviews as part of a wider survey of precis user
    reaction in the uk. findings are presented in terms of ease of
    use, effective retrieval of citations, whether too much
    information is provided in entries, the structure of index
    entries and the relationship between terms, and the possibility
    of a '1-stage' index. conclusions are that in a specialised
    field like education a sophisticated indexing technique cannot
    obviate the indexer's specialised subject knowledge, but that
    the basic principles of precis are not under attack, and
    entries should not be further simplified. a majority considered

    <text>axle: an axiomatic language for string transformations
    axle is a language designed for data manipulation. data

    according to a table of axioms, called imperatives. a
    transformation consists of a matching procedure, which decides
    where an imperative is applicable, and a replacement procedure
    that modifies that part of the workspace. imperatives are
    applied in accordance with definitions of symbolic terms,
    presented systematically in an assertion table. the process of
    definition includes the special case of recursive assertions.
    several complete programs of imperatives are given to show a
    few applications of the language. november, 1965 cohen, i.

    operations of a list processor for the long times that garbage
    collection normally requires by performing garbage collection
    on a second processor in parallel with list processing
    operations, or on a single processor time-shared with them.
    algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in this
    manner are presented and analyzed to determine sufficient
    conditions under which the list processor never needs to wait
    on the collector. these techniques are shown to require at most
    twice as much processing power as regular garbage collectors,
    if they are used efficiently. the average behavior of the
    program is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case
    performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also
    suitable for measuring the typical behavior of the algorithm.

    <text>the public library in france. its actual situation and

    the urgent need to provide equal levels of service for both
    urban and rural users. in general, the public sees libraries as
    out of date, under-resourced, and unattractive, and is largely
    unaware of recent new developments because these are restricted
    to a few centres of excellence. the public library should
    provide free comprehensive services for all' describes these
    services in detail, as they relate to documentation and
    information, and cultural activities. the division of library
    services into urban and rural structures has resulted in
    inadequate services for country areas; instead, the system
    should be reorganised into a network pattern to equalise
    distribution of resources. criticisms of municipal libraries,
    central lending libraries, and the french public library
    service in general are summarised in an appended memorandum,
    and further illustrated by an analysis of the organisation of

    argues that those who profit most from the universal

    hardware/software enterprises, and information networks. the
    arguments for and against public lending right are explored to
    establish the principles behind protecting authors' interests.
    these principles are applied to the operations of the

    assessed by examining the number of references freely available

    <text>user fluctuation as the totality of user movement.
    statistics produced by kopenick district library in berlin

    grows only slowly. these figures reflect national trends. the
    use of the term fluctuation in this context is discussed. users
    may leave a library for various reasons' unavoidably, through
    illness or death; from social necessity, as when transferring
    from the children's to the adult library; for socially
    acceptable reasons, e.g. moving house, military service;
    undesirably, because they find the library service

    centres, such as libraries, are needed to provide the
    information which people require to keep up with day-to-day
    events. such a centre should also provide information to help
    people to improve their daily life. since the country does not
    have enough libraries, more use should be made of existing
    libraries, and most of the country's libraries are in

    <text>an exponential method for the solution of systems of

    problems for systems of ordinary differential equations is
    presented. the method was designed to be general purpose in
    nature but to be especially efficient when dealing with stiff
    systems of differential equations. it is, in general, second
    order except for the case of a linear system with constant
    coefficients and linear forcing terms; in that case, the method
    is third order. it has been implemented and put to routine
    usage in biological applications-where stiffness frequently
    appears-with favorable results. when compared to a standard
    fourth order runge-kutta implementation, computation time
    required by this method has ranged from comparable for certain
    nonstiff problems to better than two orders of magnitude faster

    <text>adapting and addressing educational goals in the library
    at the austine school. school libraries and media centres vary
    widely in size, quality of service, atmosphere, and contents of

    curricula, and geography and population of the schools. austine
    school affords a good opportunity to observe those factors
    which make one situation unique, by reason of its specialised

    for extending the age limit for free public library membership
    from 16 to 18 years of age have been abandoned by de boer

    is a great deal of theoretical interest in algol 68 and in

    practical impact. problem-oriented languages may very well
    become the most important language development area in the next
    five to ten years. in the operating system area all major
    computer manufacturers set out to produce very ambitious
    multiprogramming systems, and they all ran into similar
    problems. a number of university projects,though not directly
    comparable to those of the manufacturers, have contributed
    greatly to a better understanding of operating system
    principles. important trends include the increased interest in
    the development of system measurement and evaluation

    <text>hybrid simulation models of computer systems this paper
    describes the structure and operation of a hybrid simulation
    model in which both discrete-event simulation and analytic
    techniques are combined to produce efficient yet accurate
    system models. in an example based on a simple hypothetical
    computer system, discrete-event simulation is used to model the
    arrival and activation of jobs, and a central-server queueing
    network models the use of system processors. the accuracy and
    efficiency of the hybrid technique are demonstrated by
    comparing the result and computational costs of the hybrid
    model of the example with those of an equivalent

    <text>euler: a generalization algol, and its formal definition:
    part i* a method for defining programming languages is
    developed which introduces a rigorous relationship between
    structure and meaning. the structure of a language is defined
    by a phrase structure syntax, the meaning in terms of the
    effects which the execution of a sequence of interpretation
    rules exerts upon a fixed set of variables, called the
    environment. there exists a one-to-one correspondence between
    syntactic rules and interpretation rules is determined by the
    sequence of corresponding syntactic reductions which constitute
    a parse. the individual interpretation rules are explained in
    terms of an elementary an d obvious algorithmic notation. a
    constructive method for evaluating a text is provided, and for
    certain decidable classes of languages their unambiguity is
    proved. as an example, a generalization of algol is described
    in full detail to demonstrate that concepts like
    block-structure, procedures, parameters, etc. can be defined
    adequately and precisely by this method. january, 1966 wirth,

    communicate correctly. this is demonstrated for a system
    consisting of many sending processes which deposit messages in
    a buffer and many receiving processes which remove messages
    from that buffer. the formal description of the synchronization
    mechanism makes it very easy to prove that the buffer will
    neither overflow nor underflow, that senders and receivers will
    never operate on the same message frame in the buffer nor will
    they run into a deadlock. march, 1972 habermann, a. n. parallel

    <text>ambiguity in limited entry decision tables the use of
    decision tables as a tool in systems analysis and for program
    specification is now becoming accepted. rules on redundancy,
    contradiction, and completeness for limited entry tables were
    published in 1963. these are usually used for checking,
    preceded if necessary by a conversion from extended to limited
    entry form. processors which automatically translate tables to
    more conventional program usually base their diagnostic
    facilities on these rules. in this paper it is suggested that
    these rules are unsatisfactory and that the important aspect of
    checking is to eliminate ambiguity from tables. ambiguity is
    defined and discussed, and a procedure for producing
    checked-out decision tables is proposed. the theoretical basis
    of the algorithm used is established. the importance of
    well-designed diagnostic facilities in decision table
    processors is emphasized. october, 1968 king, p. j. h. decision

    literature. the performances of 2 groups of students in
    learning the new concept of bibliographic citation, one using a
    textbook and the other the 'set of concepts' method, were
    evaluated and compared. details are given of the test groups,
    test conditions, and test procedures. the technique used to
    evaluate results is outlined and calculations presented in

    <text>structured multiprogramming this paper presents a
    proposal for structured representation of multiprogramming in a
    high level language. the notation used explicitly associates a
    data structure shared by concurrent processes with operations
    defined on it. this clarifies the meaning of programs and
    permits a large class of time-dependent errors to be caught at
    compile time. a combination of critical regions and event
    variables enables the programmer to control scheduling of
    resources among competing processes to any degree desired.
    these concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within
    operating systems but also within user programs. july, 1972

    <text>effectiveness of automated interlibrary loan. examines

    introduction of the oclc/ill subsystem on their interlibrary
    loan patterns, and the transition from the use of nysill (new
    york state interlibrary loan) to use of oclc/ill. finds that
    oclc/ill has had a major impact-material requested is arriving
    significantly faster, the load on major research libraries has
    been reduced, and smaller libraries can now share the load in
    filling interlibrary loan transactions. 25-50% of requested
    monographs are less than 5 years old-perhaps it would be more
    efficient to purchase them. retrospective collection conversion
    would be of value to interlibrary loans if carried out within

    in a general purpose discrete simulation system. two of the
    algorithms are new, one is based on an end-order tree structure
    for event notices, and another uses an indexed linear list. the
    algorithms are tested with a set of typical stochastic
    scheduling distributions especially chosen to show the
    advantages and limitations of the algorithms. the end-order
    tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous, immediate
    replacement for the algorithm in use with current simulation
    languages. the most promising algorithm uses the indexed list
    concept. it will require an adaptive routine before it can be
    employed in general purpose simulators,but its performance is
    such that further study would be fruitful. april, 1975 vaucher,

    <text>formal verification of parallel programs two formal
    models for parallel computation are presented: an abstract
    conceptual model and a parallel-program model. the former model
    does not distinguish between control and data states. the
    latter model includes the capability for the representation of
    an infinite set of control states by allowing there to be
    arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or processes) executing
    the program. an induction principle is presented which treats
    the control and data state sets on the same ground. through the
    use of "place variables," it is observed that certain
    correctness conditions can be expressed without enumeration of
    the set of all possible control states. examples are presented
    in which the induction principle is used to demonstrate proofs
    of mutual exclusion. it is shown that assertions-oriented proof
    methods are special cases of the induction principle. a special
    case of the assertions method, which is called parallel place
    assertions, is shown to be incomplete. a formalization of
    "deadlock" is then presented. the concept of a "norm" is
    introduced, which yields an extension, to the deadlock problem,
    of floyd's technique for proving termination. also discussed is
    an extension of the program model which allows each process to
    have its own local variables and permits shared global
    variables. correctness of certain forms of implementation is
    also discussed. an appendix is included which relates this work
    to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical
    formulas. july, 1976 keller, r. m. parallel program,

    <text>the teachable language comprehender: a simulation program
    and theory of language the teachable language comprehender
    (tlc) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to
    "comprehend" english text. when text which the program has not
    seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by
    correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the
    new text to a large memory. this memory is a "semantic network"
    representing factual assertions about the world. the program
    also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been
    found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these
    copies to represent the meaning of the new text. by this means,
    the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is
    encoded into the same format as that of the memory. in this
    form it can be added into the memory. both factual assertions
    for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text
    to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program
    as they are needed. tlc presently contains a relatively small
    number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but
    within the system, notations for expressing either of these are
    provided. thus the program now corresponds to a general process
    for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for
    adding the additional information this process requires to
    actually comprehend text of any particular kind. the memory
    structure and comprehension process of tlc allow new factual
    assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored
    assertions to generalize automatically. that is, once such an
    assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes
    available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in
    the future. thus the addition of a single factual assertion or
    linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in
    tlc's effective knowledge of the world and in its overall
    ability to comprehend text. the program's strategy is presented
    as a general theory of language comprehension. august,1969

    <text>significant event simulation this paper compares a new
    method of simulation organization, called the significant event
    method, with an old one, called the clock pulse method, using
    as examples two automobile traffic models. the significant
    event method is found to be more efficient than the clock pulse
    method at low levels of system interaction and less efficient
    at high levels. a simple mathematical model for the trade-off
    in the relative running time of the two methods is developed.
    the model aids in choosing between the two simulation methods
    for a particular experiment. it is concluded that the
    significant event method can be of value in the simulation of
    some systems when computational efficiency is of sufficient
    importance. june, 1975 babich, a. f. grason, j. parnas, d. l.

    <text>computer formulation of the equations of motion using
    tensor notation a means is described for extending the area of
    application of digital computers beyond the numerical data
    processing stage and reducing the need for human participation
    in the formulation of certain types of computer problems. by
    the use of tensor calculus and a computer language designed to
    facilitate symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been
    devised whereby a digital computer can be used to do
    non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation and
    differentiation. to illustrate the techniques involved, a
    digital computer has been used to derive the equations of
    motion of a point mass in a general orthogonal curvilinear
    coordinate system. since this operation involves a formulation
    in terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients,
    it provides a good demonstration of a computer's capability to
    do non-numeric work and to assist in the formulation process
    which normally precedes the numerical data processing stage.
    moreover, this particular problem serves to illustrate the
    advantages of the mathematical techniques employed. with the
    program prepared for this purpose the computer will derive the
    equations of motion in any coordinate system requested by the
    user. results are presented for the following coordinate
    systems: cylindrical polar, spherical polar, and prolate
    spheroidal. september, 1967 howard, j. c. ca670903 jb february

    several examples are given; the results with respect to the
    number of disk accesses and disk space are compared to other
    common approaches. algorithms evaluating the appropriateness of
    the above approach to a given information system are described.
    for a certain class of information systems, the normal

    <text>copyright and the new media. discusses the principles for
    the future structure of copyright which are embodied in the
    revision committee's report on proposed changes in that part of
    the copyright act which refers to private copying. the majority
    wish to see free copying in single copies for private use, but
    to restrict professional multiple copying. this restriction is
    particularly aimed at the new media' sound and videotapes,
    which have led to mass use. there has always been a conflict
    between the rights of copyright holders to economic profit from
    their works and the right of society to free enjoyment of
    cultural values. upholds the basic principle of the owner's
    sole right, but points to ways of solving copyright conflicts
    in a mass use situation via licence agreements. today, where
    technology has made collective exploitation of works of art
    possible it is natural to seek these agreements with
    organisations rather than individual artists. recommends that
    such licence agreements be concl uded, and that copyright
    holders organise themselves so as to ease the administration of
    agreements.</text>

    some of the attempts to overcome these flaws have involved

    <text>publishing in the african language' problems and

    discusses briefly the findings of a survey conducted amongst
    the main publishers of material in the african languages, and
    concludes that only books which are prescribed reading for
    examinations sell in large numbers. notes with regret that
    there is not a single centre or library in africa that is
    systematically collecting creative writing in the african
    languages. attitudes to books and reading in africa are seen as
    being governed by many social and cultural factors, and as
    being also heavily affected by the lack of a sufficient number
    of retail outlets or libraries. argues that, whilst the african
    book professions have a major role to play, the initiative for
    significant change must largely come from government backed
    programmes, and initiatives by local authorities with the aid
    of the media.</text>

    eventually to be self-governing. it also has deposit
    collections in 3 hospitals, the prison, and institutions for
    the blind, using the library's own braille books. materials
    have to be in many languages, with hindi, urdu, punjabi and
    english the most common. there is an adult lending section,
    reading room, reference section, and children's section; the
    latter is, however, given low priority. the library arranges
    free activities for adults and children, such as films,
    book-talks, author work-shops, and organises study groups. the
    book selection procedures are somewhat haphazard; stress is on
    indian and western classics. some popular scientific works are

    <text>the banking information system concept most large
    commercial banks have progressed to the point where their major
    accounting applications have been automated and more
    sophisticated usage of data processing equipment is being
    sought. this, coupled with the availability of equipment well
    suited to real-time, direct access processing,has led to
    development within some banks of the central file of data base
    approach toward a banking information system. the banking
    information system now serves the two-fold purpose of providing
    real-time responses to inquires about individual account stasus
    and providing more complex combinations of information for
    management use. both kinds of processing draw upon a common
    store of data contained in the direct access central file. this
    data base includes indexes which facilitate cross referencing
    of account information so that all relationships between bank
    and customer may be discerned. in introducing the banking
    information system concept, a gradual approach to account
    cross-referencing and file conversion is most prudent.
    generally, this system must interface with other computer
    applications already existing within the bank. july, 1966 head,

    <text>the transient response of rf and if filters to a wave
    packet summary only analysis based on fourier integral
    transforms is applied to two particular circuits a single stage
    of tuned anode coupling a single stage of tuned transformer
    coupling the analysis is valid for circuits of any bandwidth
    particular attention is paid to the build up time of a
    transient which for a band pass network is usually assumed to
    be inversely proportional to the network bandwidth the analysis
    shows that this assumption is correct for the tuned anode
    coupling circuit if the ratio of the half bandwidth to the
    resonance frequency is less than unity for the tuned
    transformer circuit however the rule does not hold good since
    for a given bandwidth there are many possible transfer
    impedances and hence transient responses the rule should
    therefore only be applied to circuits which its application is
    shown to be legitimate</text>

    <text>program translation viewed as a general data processing
    problem efficiency dictates that the overall effectiveness of a
    compiler be increased by all means available. for a compiler to
    have a substantial useful life it needs a clear logical
    structure, reliability and sound data processing techniques. a
    compiler must be based on fixed conventions to preserve
    efficiency and reliability; empty options and default
    conventions violate this dictum. use of structure to associate
    various parts of a program and economy of features promote
    clarity and reliability. march, 1966 naur, p. ca660307 jb march

    <text>on the probability distribution of the values of binary
    trees an integral equation is derived for the generating
    function for binary tree values, the values reflecting sorting
    effort. the analysis does not assume uniformly distributed
    branching ratios, and therefore is applicable to a family of
    sorting algorithms discussed by hoare, singleton, and van
    emden. the solution to the integral equation indicates that
    using more advanced algorithms in the family makes only minor
    reductions in the expected sorting effort, but substantially
    reduces the variance in sorting effort. statistical tests of
    the values of several thousand trees containing up to 10,000
    points have given first, second, and third moments of the value
    distribution function in satisfactory agreement with the
    moments computed from the generating function. the empirical
    tests, as well as the analytical results, are in agreement with
    previously published results for the first moment in the cases
    of uniform and nonuniform distribution of branching ratio, and
    for the second moment in the case of uniform distribution of
    branching ratio. february, 1971 hurwitz jr., h. binary trees,

    <text>the conservation of library collections in tropical and

    of damage and decay in areas of high temperature and humidity.
    the general point is stressed that library collections in
    tropical and sub-tropical climates are subject to the same
    dangers as those in moderate climate zones; but it must be
    understood that all these dangers are increased, some of them
    dramatically, in warm damp climates. in tropical and
    sub-tropical climates there is the threat of damage by insects
    of a nature and to an extent that is unknown in moderate
    climate zones and finally, it is not possible to change this
    situation fundamentally by any conservation or restoration
    measures, at least not without an expenditure that would be
    unrealistic in present terms of manpower and energy.</text>

    transmitted to large libraries' bookstores along t.v.
    communication channels. document reproduction has significantly
    lessened readers' expenditure of effort. automation of
    acquisitioning, cataloguing, interlibrary loans, selective
    retrieval also save readers' time. large libraries have
    automated systems for issuing bibliographies, abstracts, union
    catalogues. large information-computer centres will be created

    to encourage more of them to use libraries could be to make
    opening hours longer and more convenient for them, especially
    in the evening. libraries could reserve the mornings and early
    afternoons for administrative and processing work and then open
    to the public at least till 6 p.m., depending on local

    <text>why standards for command languages?. there are many
    reasons why the growth and spread in the use of on-line
    information retrieval systems has been less dramatic than might
    have been expected. one of the obstacles facing the user is the
    need to master many diverse user interfaces. several solutions
    are offered, yet, the only one which is really open at present
    is to decline to use all but 1 or 2 familiar systems, accepting
    that some potentially valuable information will be missed. the
    main alternatives seem to be the adoption of standards by
    system operators or the use of translating software somewhere
    between the user and the retrieval systems. with the advent of
    the microprocessor and the intelligent terminal, this latter
    alternative becomes more attractive and it may appear, at 1st
    sight, that the need for standards for command languages is
    therefore lessened, or even disappears totally. however,
    careful consideration of the possibilities offered leads to the
    conclusion that the adopti on of standards will be more rather
    than less important if much of the potential is to be
    realised.</text>

    <text>user satisfaction in the hugh stephens college library. a
    user survey was conducted at the hugh stephens college library
    to determine the degree of user satisfaction and identify
    limiting factors. analysis of data from 203 data sheets
    completed by patrons requesting specific titles reveals that
    acquisitions by the library and user error are more significant
    limiting factors in this library than either circulation or
    library error. it is recommended that further study be made of
    the extent of use of the holdings of other libraries, and of
    the proportion of users who come to browse or search by subject
    rather than specific title, before changing acquisitions
    policy. a significant proportion of user error indicates a lack
    of adequate library searching techniques, and it is suggested
    that assistance be provided for potential users through such
    means as library orientation programmes and signs alerting them
    to commonly committed errors of the location of special
    collections. report not availabl e from ntis.</text>

    <text>the innovation movement in public libraries 1981-85.
    under the aegis of the east german ministry of culture, das
    zentralinstitut fur bibliothekswesen (central institute for
    library science) is organising a programme encouraging library
    staff to devise new technical aids, work processes and economic
    measures. experience has shown that such innovations can be
    applied on a scale much wider than that of the original
    concept, determining factors being the conditions, structure
    and technical level of each library. the innovation does not
    have to be a new invention but should rather be a better use of
    existing material or ideas. those testing the innovations must
    have a good knowledge of their subject. more participation must
    be encouraged from the young staff members.</text>

    <text>a living-room for the whole town. a report on nakskov new
    main library, a combined public and school library. the 3190
    sq.m. area is split up by shelves, moveable partition walls and
    4 large garden areas. although the prime function is to be a
    public library, an agreement with the adjacent educational
    centre, housing commercial, technical and senior secondary
    schools, allows the centre use of the library against a payment
    of 300,000 kr. annually to be used partly on salary to a
    librarian. it is hoped that the specialised material to be
    acquired for the students will also benefit the public and that
    the 130 seat theatre hall will attract a ready audience from
    the schools. interviews with librarians reveal determination to
    protect the interests of the general public and by placement of
    the educational department furthest away avoid dominance by the

    <text>serials education in master's degree programs in
    accredited library schools in the united states and canada.
    (phd thesis-florida state university.) a questionnaire survey
    was sent to the directors of the 68 us and canadian accredited
    library schools, concerning courses on serials acquisition,
    collection development, control, cataloguing, and
    classification. 9 telephone interviews were held with the
    teachers of such courses to identify their characteristics and
    objectives. the 56 questionnaire responses showed that less
    attention was paid to serials control than to other
    serials-related topics and that there were significant
    differences in teaching of concepts in separate and
    non-separate serials courses.</text>

    <text>stagnation in the kibbutz library. 2 characteristics of
    kibbutz libraries are giving cause for concern;
    decentralisation; and the average age of kibbutz librarians.
    decentralisation has historic and social causes. formerly, most
    librarians were volunteers and various groups in the kibbutz
    population had separate areas of residence and activity. modern
    kibbutz society and organisation have changed, but many small
    libraries have remained in existence. decentralisation has many
    drawbacks' inefficiency, areas of interest not covered by any
    library, inconvenience of many readers and lack of a strong
    library that could become a focal point in the cultural life of
    the kibbutz. the 24 librarians serving in the kibbutzim
    surveyed averaged 53.3 years, only 5 of them being younger than
    50. this situation rules out much in the way of development and
    innovation. calls for a serious academic study of kibbutz
    libraries.</text>

    will be public institutions and 10 of these libraries. about 60
    organisations will provide information and db will coordinate
    the information supplied to the teledata base. db was able to
    argue successfully against fees for the use of the teledata
    during the experimental period. by being involved in the

    better able to influence it. this also explains why db is a

    for negative values of the argument is the reciprocal of the
    approximation for corresponding positive values. these methods
    lead to approximations which are much superior to the commonly
    used convergents of the gaussian continued fraction for the
    exponential. coefficients and errors are given for the

    <text>impact of computers on the undergraduate mathematics
    curriculum the use of computers to permit the widespread
    application of mathematical ideas requiring computation in
    science and technology is extremely significant for the
    understanding of our current society. student interest in this
    development is intense and if properly utilized should yield a
    much better understanding of mathematical concepts as well as
    the ideas of programming and logical structure which have been
    introduced into many fields by the use of computers. the
    present paper suggests that that portion of the undergraduate
    mathematical curriculum which is preparation for the use of
    mathematics by persons who are not professional mathematicians
    be modified to include the extensions and clarifications which
    are possible because of computers. an early introduction to
    programming is desirable to permit a continuing use of
    automatic computation to illustrate and clarify mathematical
    concepts. following the calculus equation stage an intensive
    introduction to numerical analysis should be added to the
    current curriculum. in addition to providing competence in the
    mostly used computing techniques, it would permit a more
    sophisticated utilization of the advanced mathematical ideas
    associated with complex variables and transform theories.

    investigation was a simula based simulation model reflecting an
    early framework for a planned burroughs b6500 time-sharing
    system. inasmuch as the b6500 system is based upon the use of
    variable sized segments and a dynamic overlay procedure, data
    is also presented which provides some indication of the
    effectiveness of this type of organization in a time-sharing
    environment. the design characteristics and operational

    found similarly in programming. the development of natural
    languages toward flexion less, word-order based language types
    speaks for programming language design based on general,
    abstract constructs. by analogy with incidents of the history
    of artificial, auxiliary languages it is suggested that fortran
    and cobol will remain dominant for a long time to come. the
    most promising avenues for further work of wide influence are

    <text>detection of three-dimensional patterns of atoms in
    chemical structures an algorithm for detecting occurrences of a
    three-dimensional pattern of objects within a larger structure
    is presented. the search technique presented uses the geometric
    structure of the pattern to define characteristics demanded of
    candidates for matching. this is useful in cases where the
    properties of each atom, considered individually, do not
    adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings.
    several applications of this technique in the field of
    chemistry are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common
    constellation of atoms in molecules possessing similar
    biological activities; (2) in x-ray crystallography: fitting a
    structure or a structural fragment to a set of peaks in the
    electron-density distribution of a fourier map; (3) in chemical
    documentation; retrieving from a file the structures containing
    specified substructures. april, 1979 lesk, a.m.

    represented by a combined model. a transformation of the
    combined model yields a new model in which additional timing
    information is also contained. analysis of these models prior
    to execution yields information valuable in determining

    <text>breaking substitution ciphers using a relaxation
    algorithm substitution ciphers are codes in which each letter
    of the alphabet has one fixed substitute, and the word
    divisions do not change. in this paper the problem of breaking
    substitution ciphers is represented as a probabilistic labeling
    problem. every code letter is assigned probabilities of
    representing plain text letters. these probabilities are
    updated in parallel for all code letters, using joint letter
    probabilities. iterating the updating scheme results in
    improved estimates that finally lead to breaking the cipher.
    the method is applies successfully to two examples. november,

    <text>hierarchical geometric models for visible surface
    algorithms the geometric structure inherent in the definition
    of the shapes of three-dimensional objects and environments is
    used not just to define their relative motion and placement,
    but also to assist in solving many other problems of systems
    for producing pictures by computer. by using an extension of
    traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy,
    five significant improvements to current techniques are
    possible. first, the range of complexity of an environment is
    greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given
    scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. second, a meaningful
    way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a
    scene. third, "clipping" becomes a very fast logarithmic search
    for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of
    view. fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a
    graphical "working set," or fraction of the total structure
    that should be present in primary store for immediate access by
    the visible surface algorithm. finally, the geometric structure
    suggests a recursive descent, visible surface algorithm in
    which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the
    visible complexity of the scene. october, 1976 clark, j. h.

    structures in patents. 2. gensal, a formal language for the
    description of generic chemical structures. a formal language,
    gensal, is described which is designed for the concise and
    unambiguous representation of generic structures from chemical
    patents ('markush formulas') in a manner which is intelligible
    to a chemist, yet sufficiently formalised for automatic
    analysis by a computer. gensal contains a number of facilities
    for showing the alternatives possible in a generic structure
    and any special restrictions placed on their variety.
    experience to date suggests that gensal is capable of dealing
    with most of the types of generic statement encountered in
    patents.</text>

    <text>space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable
    errors in this paper trade-offs among certain computational
    factors a given set of messages. two new hash-coding methods
    are examined and compared with a particular conventional
    hash-coding method. the computational factors considered are
    the size of the hash area (space), the time required to
    identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject
    time), and an allowable error frequency. the new methods are
    intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the
    hash-coded information from that associated with conventional
    methods. the reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting
    the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission
    may be tolerable in some applications, in particular,
    applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a
    core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using
    conventional methods. in such applications, it is envisaged
    that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller
    core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods
    and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps
    time-consuming test to "catch" the small fraction of errors
    associated with new methods. an example is discussed which
    illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods.
    analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a
    small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
    members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area
    to be used without increasing reject time. july, 1970 bloom, b.

    <text>pattern width at a given angle that the pattern feature
    "width as a function of angle" possesses several possible
    interpretations is demonstrated in this paper, which is a
    review of the width concept in pattern recognition and the
    geometrical concept itself. the object of the work is to
    clarify how the word description can be made precise so that
    computer algorithms for feature extraction may be obtained; the
    focus is on the theoretical subject matter. the results consist
    of a set-theoretic definition of width-at-angle, a theorem
    relating it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and
    descriptions of alternate widths. all widths are calculated for
    an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons are
    given. substantial variation in width-at-angle magnitude is
    found. the principal conclusion is that the set-theoretic
    width-at-angle is a useful pattern feature when it can be
    easily computed. further investigation of the information
    contained in only part of a width function is recommended for
    cases where computation of width-at-angle is difficult.

    <text>asymmetric memory hierarchies a study is presented of
    some of the system implications of memory hierarchies in which
    the backing or secondary store has a very small read time,
    relative of both the time required for writing and to the read
    time of conventional backing storage devices. several analytic
    models are introduced, and it is shown that such hierarchies
    may operate in ways which differ from those of more
    conventional hierarchies. in particular, it is shown that it
    may not be necessary to multiprogram in such a situation. in
    the past, backing storage devices have been roughly symmetric
    with respect to their read and write times. this situation may
    not continue, as several devices are currently under
    development which may have a very small read-time/write-time
    ratio. this study places particular emphasis on one such
    system-the rca read/write holographic optical memory. april,

    <text>the zero growth syndrome and the libraries' work for

    the 80s, organised by the danish library inspectorate and held
    in oct 81. libraries are faced with a situation in which their
    use, especially that involving reference services, grows, while
    demands for cuts or zero growth are made. librarians have to
    give up some services, such as lengthy literature searches, in
    order to keep a balance in the general service level and are
    faced with an invidious choice between the kinds of
    material-newspapers, reference books, journals-which have to be
    axed. there is a need for an overall planning body which can
    decide priorities on professional grounds. argues for
    strengthening of the reference sections in smaller libraries by
    appointment of reference librarians and for the free
    distribution of the national bibliography to all publicly owned
    libraries. centrally produced reference aids help in the choice
    of priorities and free staff for othe r tasks, but more are
    needed. a period of cuts should be used to plan future
    expansion.</text>

    extraction through estimation of relevance) system was designed
    to apply such strategies effectively and inexpensively for a
    changing data base of up to 20,000 messages (texts or
    documents) of about 2,000 characters each, with new messages
    arriving at the rate of 4,000-5,000 daily. it runs on a dec

    of pattern standardization techniques based on geometrical
    projection is applied to a file of digitized hand printed
    numerals obtained from sales clerks. the principle involves
    transforming a quadrilateral specified in terms of the convex
    hull of each pattern into a square. the amount of overlap
    within each class of characters versus the amount between
    classes is used to evaluate the degree of normalization
    achieved with respect to other published methods including size
    and shear normalization through moments. august, 1970 nagy, g.

    <text>on the optimization of performance of time-sharing
    systems by simulation a simulation model of a time-sharing
    system with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite
    auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
    parameters such as store size, number of jobs allowed to
    execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm, etc. the
    effects of these variations on a measure of system performance
    is used to ascertain which of the parameters controllable by
    the job-scheduling algorithm, including the scheduling itself,
    require optimization, and which of the parameters not normally
    controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked effect
    on system performance. system performance is based upon the
    mean cost of delay to all jobs processed. it is shown that
    significant improvements in the measure of system performance
    can be obtained by using variable time-slice techniques and by
    selecting the optimum round-robin cycle time. it appears that
    these features would benefit from optimization whereas other
    parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect
    system performance in a predictable manner and would not
    benefit from optimization. features not normally under the
    control of the scheduling algorithm can also have a marked
    effect on the measure of performance; in particular, supervisor
    overheads, the size of the store, and the speed of the cpu. a
    comparison is made between the results of the simulation model
    and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented nonpreemptive
    time-sharing systems. the comparison is found to be very
    favorable. june, 1972 blatny, j. clark, s. r. rourke, t. a.

    <text>the synthetic approach to decision table conversion
    previous approaches to the problem of automatically converting
    decision tables to computer programs have been based on
    decomposition. at any stage, one condition is selected for
    testing, and two smaller problems (decision tables with one
    less condition) are created. an optimal program (with respect
    to average execution time or storage space, for example) is
    located only through implicit enumeration of all possible
    decision trees using a technique such as branch-and-bound. the
    new approach described in this paper uses dynamic programming
    to synthesize an optimal decision tree from which a program can
    be created. using this approach, the efficiency of creating an
    optimal program is increased substantially, permitting
    generation of optimal programs for decision tables with as many
    as ten to twelve conditions. june, 1976 schumacher, h. sevcik,

    <text>on simulating networks of parallel processes in which
    simultaneous events may occur some of the problems of
    simulating discrete event systems, particularly computer
    systems, on a conventional digital computer are dealt with. the
    systems are assumed to be described as a network of
    interconnected sequential processes. briefly reviewed are the
    common techniques used to handle such simulations when
    simultaneous events do not occur, can be ignored, or can be
    handled by simple priority rules. following this, the problem
    of dealing with simultaneous events in separate processes is
    introduced. an abstraction of this problem is developed which
    admits solution for a majority of commonly encountered
    problems. the technique will either find a method of simulating
    the parallel events or report that none can be found. in some
    of the latter cases it is shown to be possible to find a
    solution by extending the information available to the solution
    technique, but in many cases the technique becomes
    computationally unfeasible when the additional information is

    loans in the provision of information services to science and
    industry, held 23-24 apr 79. interlibrary lending system in
    finland comprises a network of research libraries as well as
    some 50% of public libraries. regional libraries have the role
    of interlending centres; the helsinki city library has the
    function of the national centre. organisation of the system is
    described. although there are not, so far, any fixed procedures
    the regional centres act as intermediaries between the public
    and the research libraries. in its role of the finnish
    bibliographical centre the helsinki university library
    publishes the union catalogue of foreign publications. the
    library has the fullest collection, outside the ussr, of
    russian 1820-1917 imprints due to its legal deposit rights to

    procedures to find maximal cliques in general graphs. finally
    an exact method is given which performs better than the

    obtain measurements of the cost of procedure linkage in pl/i
    and the savings achievable via procedure integration in the

    <text>the synthesis of loop predicates current methods for
    mechanical program verification require a complete predicate
    specification on each loop. because this is tedious and error
    prone, producing a program with complete, correct predicates is
    reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machine
    assistance. this paper discusses techniques for mechanically
    synthesizing loop predicates. two classes of techniques are
    considered: (1) heuristic methods which derive loop predicates
    from boundary conditions and/or partially specified inductive
    assertions: (2) extraction methods which use input predicates
    and appropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain classes
    of loop predicates by an evaluation on the weak interpretation.

    programme (lip) was implemented at ohio state university, it
    was evaluated at each stage by means of questionnaires. data
    derived from the questionnaires helped change the content of
    the lip lectures, the type of materials distributed to the
    students, and the format of the exercises. it also evaluated
    the success the programme had in reaching incoming students and
    in giving them experience in using library tools. separate

    <text>workplace libraries in east germany' mutual competition
    for the best loan statistics. after the 2nd world war, west
    germany continued as it left off in 1933, with factory
    libraries in the old patriarchal form and library policies with
    traditional bourgeois ideals. in east germany, however, a
    period of denazification and rebuilding of society in a
    socialist form followed the war. libraries received high
    priority in the anti-fascist propaganda campaign, with access
    to libraries in 96% of districts in 1957 compared to 40% in
    1947. a purge of library books was carried out on stalinist
    principles with some libraries losing up to 90% of their stock.
    however, the public library system expanded rapidly, but
    without deviation from the ideological line in book selection.
    a network of workplace libraries under the trade unions has
    also been developed in keeping with the importance attached to
    libraries for ideological education. the basis for these
    libraries is the maxim' all workers must read. th e libraries
    must reach a certain norm in lending figures and control with
    the material borrowed is possible. the workplace libraries, far
    from being an expression of working class democracy, are an
    ideological instrument of the trade union leadership directed
    at the working class.</text>

    solved by weeding. the phenomenon is more complex and the

    regard to the requirements of the library and information

    then elaborates on the facilities which may be added to improve
    its intelligence, such as internal memory, enhanced display,
    multiple peripherals, improved communications ability,
    sophisticated control facilities, and programmability. the
    facilities are described and some idea of their utility is
    given. the uses of the terminal are discussed in areas such as
    information retrieval, cataloguing, training, data entry, and
    library housekeeping. useful facilities of an intelligent

    <text>the chances of a university education within the
    framework of communication sciences for librarians in public
    libraries. in berlin the library school is now completely
    integrated into the university as part of the communication
    science faculty, the 1st time that this has occurred in
    germany. objections to university status for librarianship
    courses were formerly made on the grounds that the
    librarianship courses occupy only 6 semesters where other
    university courses require 8 or 9 and that a university course
    would provide inadequate practical training. if librarianship
    is to be regarded as part of communication science new
    theoretic fields must be developed which will affect
    librarianship training. librarians must be trained in critical
    media selection and information dissemination; in public
    librarianship personal communication between staff and readers
    must be improved to counteract the impersonal effects of
    increasing centralisation. librarians need a better general
    education and knowledge of connected academic subjects like
    sociology and psychology.</text>

    <text>toward the development of a library management
    information system. outlines an approach, with both widespread
    implications and specific practical steps, for assembling some
    of the data that library administrators now require in order to
    make libraries operate more effectively. these data have not
    been assembled in the past because the costs in staff time
    alone have been and continue to be prohibitive for most
    institutions. one major impediment to effective library
    administration is the lack of a comprehensive management
    information system. some investigators in this area seem to
    have become fascinated with the potential value of various
    elusive and fugitive library statistical measures, but they
    have given little attention to the operational systems that
    would be required to assemble these data. the proposal outlined
    here stresses the need for a total systems approach, based upon
    standardised terminology; machine-aided data collection, and
    customised computer processing and reporting as we ll as
    systematic training and documentation.</text>

    <text>a modification of efroymson's technique for stepwise
    regression analysis the computational technique conventionally
    used for stepwise multiple linear regression requires the
    storage of an n x n matrix of data. when the number of
    variables, n, is large, this requirement taxes the storage
    capacity of presently used machinery. the near symmetry of the
    matrices involved permits a modification requiring only half
    the storage and computations of the conventional algorithm and
    this additional storage allows the analysis of problems
    containing more variables. alternatively, it permits the
    analysis of problems containing the same number of variables
    but with all computations performed in double precision.

    <text>on a divide-and-correct method for variable precision
    division described in this paper is a divide-and-correct method
    for variable precision division in digital computers. unlike
    the earlier methods of stein and pope, the present method uses
    a suitably rounded form of the normalized divisor for getting
    an estimate of the quotient characters. this results in a
    correction of at most plus or minus one to the estimate, to
    obtain the exact quotient character. it is believed that this
    method will be widely applicable for division operations in
    variable word-length character-oriented machines. march, 1965

    <text>archives and libraries. following a 1979 study tour
    covering 6 local history archives in denmark, relationships,
    joint functions and finance of such archives and local history
    collections are discussed. the 1st local history archive in
    denmark was established in faborg in 1937; by 1979 there were
    about 240. a 1978 report defined material belonging
    respectively to local history collections and local history
    archives, recommending coordination by the library but
    considerable autonomy for the archives. while details differ,
    cooperation seems generally satisfactory. financial
    arrangements vary widely, still with many voluntary archivists.
    with no comparable activity in norway, it seems necessary to
    survey existing resources and institutions and evaluate the
    situation. priorities are collection, arrangement and indexing,
    conservation, and availability. public libraries, though the
    natural home for local history archives, would require
    additional finance and staffing. local organisations should be
    approached, manpower and resources coordinated, and help sought
    from regional and central authorities.</text>

    <text>improving the access time for random access files
    clustering in the key set is decreased by smoothing the
    key-to-address transformation, and by adding shadow buckets to
    an open chaining file. the keys are pre-hashed before the
    address division, to remove the effect of sequential properties
    in the key set. shadow buckets in the key search sequence
    reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading, and
    decrease the number of maximum probes needed to locate a
    record. the combined effects of these techniques lead to
    improved file performance for secondary storage devices, as
    shown by empirical studies. march, 1977 clapson, p. hashing,

    of similar scientific journals by their cross-citations, taking
    into account data from the journal citation reports (jcr). they
    also help to improve the jcr structure and widen its uses for
    the evaluation of scientific journals. these methods are
    applied to analyse critically the principles of ranking

    <text>algem - an algebraic manipulator algem is a package of
    subprograms written in slip, fortran iv and map 7094 ii to
    manipulate algebraic expressions. algem's basic algebraic
    operations are additions, subtractions, multiplications,
    division and exponentiation. it is capable of handling any
    number of single letter variables, variable exponents, and of
    finding the highest common factor of two polynomials. also
    included are such functions as substitution, differentiation,
    determining coefficients of specified variables, solving a
    linear equation, basic i/o routines plus other special purpose
    and arithmetic routines. the major innovation of algem over
    other manipulators is the assignment of types to all
    expressions and the use of a standard ordering procedure.

    <text>a simple linear model of demand paging performance
    predicting the performance of a proposed automatically managed
    multilevel memory system requires a model of the patterns by
    which programs refer to the information stored in the memory.
    some recent experimental measurements on the multics virtual
    memory suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably
    simple program reference model will suffice. the simple model
    combines the effect of the information reference pattern with
    the effect of the automatic management algorithm to produce a
    single, composite statement: the mean number of memory
    references between paging exceptions increases linearly with
    the size of the paging memory. the resulting model is easy to
    manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse problems as
    choosing an optimum size for a paging memory, arranging for
    reproducible memory usage charges, and estimating the amount of
    core memory sharing. april, 1974 saltzer, j. h. paging, demand

    librarians should take an active interest in the work of their
    users and their education and professional expertise should
    allow them to do so. a survey in the slovak academy of science
    had shown that most sought after are information sources 1-3

    library of congress network advisory committee and is a working
    document inviting comment and discussion throughout the library
    and information service. it offers 3 scenarios for the
    construction of a nationwide library and information network'
    (1) a legislative model dependent on congress to mandate the
    network and prescribe its governing structure; (2) an
    evolutionary model resulting from 2ad hoc1 agreements; and (3)
    a private sector model developing from the non-profit and
    for-profit private systems in response to demand from the

    <text>estimates of distributions of random variables for
    certain computer communications traffic models a study of
    multiaccess computer communications has characterized the
    distributions underlying an elementary model of the
    user-computer interactive process. the model used is elementary
    in the sense that many of the random variables that generally
    are of interest in computer communications studies can be
    decomposed into the elements of this model. data were examined
    from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is
    shown to be robust; that is each of the variables of the model
    has the same distribution independent of which of the four
    systems is being examined. it is shown that the gamma
    distribution can be used to describe the discrete variables.
    approximations to the gamma distribution by the exponential
    distribution are discussed for the systems studied. december

    <text>analysis of the availability of computer systems using
    computer- aided algebra analytical results, related to the
    availability of a computer system constructed of unreliable
    processors, are presented in this paper. these results are
    obtained by using various computer-aided algebraic manipulation
    techniques. a major purpose of this paper is to demonstrate
    that the difficulties of obtaining analytical solutions to
    markov processes can be considerably reduced by the application
    of symbol manipulation programs. since many physical systems
    can be modeled by markov and semi-markov processes, the
    potential range of application of these techniques is much
    wider than the problem of availability analyzed here. july,

    centres of scientific, technical and economic information are
    at present in operation not only in design centres and research
    institutes, but also in all larger factories. the core of such
    a centre is the technical library. in most libraries,
    periodicals and monographs still prevail, but lately patents,
    standards, dissertations, research reports, trade catalogues
    and documentary films are available. the centres' activities
    depend, of course, very much on staff and equipment. building
    up data and documentation bases, under exploration of internal
    and external resources, is of primary importance. translations,
    especially those from foreign languages into slovak and czech
    are also available. information users are taught to use
    information sources more efficiently and effectively. in
    addition to other relevant activities, including their own
    continuing education, information scient ists and other staff
    should engage in theoretical studies and research, the results
    of which should be published wherever possible.</text>

    <text>the loss for business is the library's gain. a portrait
    of vissenbjerg library service, funen, denmark which has
    recently attained full-time status. this was made possible
    through the savings incurred when the library, formerly housed
    in a school, bought space in a shopping centre where many shops
    had had to close. commercial advertising methods were used to
    attract readers. the library is now open 20 hours a week and
    staff has expanded. the development has been helped by the 2.4
    million kr. grant from the library inspectorate, which also
    partly covers running costs during the 1st 3 years. in an
    interview with the librarian, ole hansen, the problems of a
    rapidly growing readership were discussed. he is hopeful that
    acquisitions will keep pace with loans. sees the library as a
    place where democracy is nurtured and where people can meet and
    feel at home. interviews local politicians, who are satisfied
    with the library's location and hope to be able to preserve the
    4 part-time branches. inter views 2 of the part-time

    total of 200 books from the school library in 9 weeks. the
    readers were given a time in which to read each book and used a
    form to report on the content, illustrations and ease of
    reading. these comments were read to the class each week. the
    1st batch of books was chosen by the 2 teachers concerned, the
    next by teachers and pupils together in the library, and the
    last mainly by the pupils themselves. if no book attracted a
    child, he or she could chose 1 from the library with help from
    the librarian. a 'book thermometer' in the classroom showed
    progress in reading the 200 books. an exhibition on the project
    was mounted in the library and a tape was made of some of the
    readers' opinions. the campaign stimulated interest in reading
    and in borrowing books from the school library and some
    children who had never read a book before now did so, sometimes
    as a result of the recorded comments. the aim was fulfilled,
    all 200 books being read during the 9-week period.</text>

    <text>efficient string matching: an aid to bibliographic search
    this paper describes a simple, efficient algorithm to locate
    all occurrences of any of a finite number of keywords in a
    string of text. the algorithm consists of constructing a finite
    state pattern matching machine from the keywords and then using
    the pattern matching machine to process the text string in a
    single pass. construction of the pattern matching machine takes
    time proportional to the sum of the lengths of the keywords.
    the number of state transitions made by the pattern matching
    machine in processing the text string is independent of the
    number of keywords. the algorithm has been used to improve the
    speed of a library bibliographic search program by a factor of
    5 to 10. june, 1975 aho, a. v. corasick, m. j. keywords and

    <text>methods for analyzing data from computer simulation
    experiments this paper addresses itself to the problem of
    analyzing data generated by computer simulations of economic
    systems. we first turn to a hypothetical firm, whose operation
    is represented by single-channel, multistation queueing model.
    the firm seeks to maximize total expected profit for the coming
    period by selecting one of five operating plans, where each
    plan incorporates a certain marketing strategy, an allocation
    of productive inputs, and a total cost. the results of the
    simulated activity under each plan are subjected to an f-test,
    two multiple comparison methods, and a multiple ranking method.
    we illustrate, compare, and evaluate these techniques. the
    paper adopts the position that the particular technique of
    analysis (possibly not any one of the above) chosen by the
    experimenter should be an expression of his experimental
    objective: the f-test tests the homogeneity of the plans;
    multiple comparison methods quantify their differences; and
    multiple ranking methods directly identify the one best plan or
    best plans. november, 1967 naylor, t. h. wertz, k. wonnacott,

    of reading in relation to the proliferation of audio-visual
    media, from the viewpoints of both the recreational and
    informational advantages offered. in the library, the child is
    free to choose his own reading material, and it is here that
    the mediation of an adult is essential to ensure the young
    initiate is encouraged in his enthusiasms, in learning how to
    use and enjoy books, and in appreciating the relationship
    between reading and life. without the intervention of the

    efficient conversion facilities for putting graphical

    form are therefore much needed. one of the most commonly
    employed devices for obtaining permanent graphical output from
    digital computers is the microfilm plotter. regrettably,

    middle-class citizens for educational and recreational
    purposes. the catalogue of 1 such library, die arnoldsche
    bibliothek in budissen, 1799-1806, is 1 of the rare books in
    the public library of potsdam. comprising a main volume and 13
    supplements, it lists 7,000 titles in accession order. the
    library stocked mainly fiction from germany and abroad, of
    which some works have now become classics. the fiction stock
    also reflected the contemporary enthusiasm for tales about
    mediaeval chivalry and the supernatural. there were also about
    400 dramatic works and 100 on travel and contemporary

    <text>toward automatic program synthesis an elementary outline
    of the theorem-proving approach to automatic program synthesis
    is given, without dwelling on technical details. the method is
    illustrated by the automatic construction of both recursive and
    iterative programs operating on natural numbers,lists, and
    trees, in order to construct a program satisfying certain
    specifications a theorem induced by those specifications is
    proved, and the desired program is extracted from the proof.
    the same technique is applied to transform recursively defined
    functions into iterative programs, frequently with a major gain
    inefficiency. it is emphasized that in order to construct a
    program with loops or with recursion, the principle of
    mathematical induction must be applied. the relation between
    the version of the induction rule used and the form of the
    program constructed is explored in some detail. march, 1971

    historical perspective on analogic recording of acoustical
    phenomena from edison's phonograph to modern hi-fi equipment.
    only those sources which offer a recording of real sound have
    the same historical status as written or printed sources. as
    such, the education of music historians and music librarians
    should include the scholarly study and evaluation of
    recordings, so that students may learn how to date records.

    machine such as the ibm 360 the familiar multiplicative
    congruential generator is examined in the context of the type
    of two's complement arithmetic used in the ibm 360 series.
    different sequences of residues are considered and
    relationships established among them. it is shown that a
    sequence of positive and negative residues may be produced more
    simply and economically than with the conventional approach and
    yet have twice the period of the latter without loss of
    desirable statistical properties. another easily generated
    sequence involving absolute values is also shown to have twice
    the period but with less attractive statistical properties. the
    statistical properties of these sequences are given and related
    to previously established criteria. july, 1969 hemmerle, w. j.

    <text>the description list of concepts a concept is defined as
    a class of objects whose members can be distinguished by
    processing its properties. property is defined to mean a
    partition of the set of all objects into disjoint classes. the
    formal definition of a concept is recursive in nature. a
    concept is described by a list structure. a one-to-one
    correspondence is established between the recursive definition
    of a concept and its description list structure. like the
    definition, the description list structure of a concept is also
    built up from elementary list structures by a recursive
    process. the list structures obtained this way are compared
    with the description list structure discussed by the author in

    multi-purpose rooms for committee meetings, conferences and
    staff training sessions. large book stocks averaging 300,000
    volumes lead to space shortages. staff include both state
    employees and volunteers. help for culturally underprivileged
    areas is provided by' direct loan to the public from mobile

    <text>the example of the 'marburg model'. critical summary of
    the progress made in introducing a coordinated library system
    at marburg university which was especially suited as a model
    for this purpose because the central alphabetical catalogue had
    been in existence since the 19th century and had been
    systematically extended since 1962; and new buildings for many
    of the library facilities have led to excellent lending
    conditions and close proximity between university buildings and
    library services. the coordination programme aims at, and has
    partially realised the integration of many small institute
    libraries into 28 library complexes with 52 independant library
    units. one important measure is the construction of a central
    medical library integrating the present 37 department
    libraries. it is possible to see that the programme initiated
    at marburg will lead to improved cooperation and integration in
    the library service and would be suitable for universities of a

    views on a danish report.d iscusses a report by a danish
    working party on catalogue products, published in 1980, and
    compares the danish and swedish solutions. the proposed danish
    system can be described as a mixture of libris and bums and
    considerable central guidance by the library centre is assumed.
    the working party seems to have little faith in the ability of
    individual libraries to catalogue according to the norms, for
    it proposes that central libraries help the smaller libraries
    with the decentralised input. the costs of this system are,
    however, high, and the swedish system, where the library
    service catalogues from photocopied title pages those titles
    not found in the central data base, is preferable. criticises
    the report for not carrying out economic costing of the
    implementation of the standard specifications. the report
    exaggerates the costs of producing local catalogues in printed
    form and neglects to consider use of modern technology, e.g.
    laser printers, for this production.</text>

    <text>all libraries should be for all. argues that danish
    public libraries are no longer follow the democratic tradition
    of anglo-saxon libraries, nor do they respond to the new
    signals coming from the uk and the usa, where the social
    importance of libraries and the need for coordination of
    library services are stressed and where it is felt that
    libraries as arsenals of knowledge have the solution to man's
    global problems. in sweden too there is a tendency towards a
    unified library system. insists that all library types should
    be democratically controlled under 1 ministry; the separatist
    attitude of research libraries is therefore regrettable.
    libraries should define their users more broadly, now that the
    educational level of the population has risen and users need
    material at all levels. economic cuts necessitate a unified
    system to distribute resources. use of the new information
    technology in libraries is a question of the survival of the
    democratic library, it can revolutionise rural life an d
    education. it is society through its democratic institutions
    which must decide whether information is to be a public,
    democratically controlled, or a private concern.</text>

    <text>transition network grammars for natural language analysis
    the use of augmented transition network grammars for the
    analysis of natural language sentences is described.
    structure-building actions associated with the arcs of the
    grammar network allow for the reordering, restructuring, and
    copying of constituents necessary to produce deep-structure
    representations of the type normally obtained from a
    transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for
    a powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses
    and take advantage of semantic information to guide the
    parsing. the advantage of this model for natural language
    analysis are discussed in detail and illustrated by examples.
    an implementation of an experimental parsing system for
    transition network grammars is briefly described. october, 1970

    the chairman's turn to speak (part) 2. text of an interview
    with dr. j.j. postma, chairman of the nblc on the 10th
    anniversary of the founding of the centre. postma believes that
    librarians in the netherlands should now come to terms with the
    new public services act, which will replace the existing public
    libraries act. by refusing to accept the act librarians are in
    danger of being left out in the cold. in postma's view the
    danger of the new act lies in the devolution of responsibility
    for the public services, including public libraries, from
    national to local government. in some local authorities, he
    adds, town festivals may receive greater priority than the
    library service. the nblc must convince the government of the
    need for an information act which includes the public library
    service. (for an abstract of part 1, 2see1 82/5007).</text>

    given an ordered set e1, e2,..., en of n computer components,
    for each permutation of the elements e1, e2.., en, there is
    attached a value of an integer function f. the algorithm finds
    a local minimum of f by evaluating the set {delta f} of the
    increments corresponding to a certain set of exchanges of two
    elements.then the exchange corresponding to the least negative
    increment of {delta f} is performed. the process is iterated
    and stopped when the set of the increments is a positive or
    empty set, which, it is proved, corresponds to a minimum. the
    procedure is similar to the downhill method for finding the
    minimum of a real function f(p), and can be applied to other

    d being supplied by rf waves with d the centre of the sphere
    would coincide with a maximum of the wave interference field
    the rf waves could be due to an oscillatory process in the

    <text>the librarian, informatics, and the interrelation between
    professionals working in libraries today. paper presented at
    the 14th brazilian seminar on informatics and library science,
    sao paulo, 16-23 oct 81. the library of today is described with
    reference to recent organisational and technical innovations,
    within the context of its long history of development. to
    fulfil its responsibilities of collecting, processing and
    disseminating information in the 1980s, the library has become
    increasingly reliant on information analysis; the availability
    of new techniques and technology has freed professionals from
    many traditional tasks and professional training has altered
    greatly in scope and orientation. compares and contrasts the
    roles of the librarian and the information scientist in a
    society like brazil undergoing rapid development, pointing out
    the potential danger in lack of communication between them when
    complementing cooperation is essential to meet economic and
    social needs.</text>

    <text>what books do people need?. since librarians themselves
    are well educated, there is always a danger that they may cater
    solely for the wishes of an elite minority and, by excluding
    ephemeral literature from stock, discourage many other people
    from using the library. the west german national library plan
    of 1973 states clearly that libraries must cater for everyone,
    even if problems are caused by limited budgets. it is important
    to remember that emphemeral literature has a relaxing effect on
    many people, in contrast to the stimulating effect caused by
    more demanding works. a possible solution would be to exclude
    less valuable material, such as works involving pornography and
    violence and then to include some trivia if careful analysis of
    reader structure demands it.</text>

    <text>organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged
    memory systems matrix representations and operations are
    examined for the purpose of minimizing the page faulting
    occurring in a paged memory system. it is shown that carefully
    designed matrix algorithms can lead to enormous savings in the
    number of page faults occurring when only a small part of the
    total matrix can be in main memory at one time. examination of
    addition, multiplication, and inversion algorithms shows that a
    partitioned matrix representation (i.e. one submatrix or
    partition per page) in most cases induced fewer page faults
    than a row-by-row representation. the number of page-pulls
    required by these matrix manipulation algorithms is also
    studied as a function of the number of pages of main memory
    available to the algorithm. march, 1969 mckellar, a. c. coffman

    <text>animator: an on-line two-dimensional film animation
    system animator is a computer animation system which was
    designed to overcome some of the inherent disadvantages
    associated with conventional computer animation techniques.the
    dec-338 serves as an input terminal for movie making, allowing
    the trial and error design of picture sequences in a
    conversational mode. during all stages on the system input
    elements (light pen, pushbuttons, and teletype) is maintained.
    at the user's request, this record is sent to the ibm 360/75
    where the s-d 4020 instructions necessary to produce the same
    sequence of pictures can be generated. it is anticipated that
    one of the primary contributions of animator will be the
    provision of a facility which will allow any professor to
    produce his own expository film strips. april, 1971 talbot, p.

    <text>on the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into
    modules this paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for
    improving the flexibility ad comprehensibility of a system
    while allowing the shortening of its development time. the
    effectiveness of a "modularization" is dependent upon the
    criteria used in dividing the system into modules. a system
    design problem is presented and both a conventional and
    unconventional decomposition are described. it is shown that
    the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for
    the goals outlined. the criteria used in arriving at the
    decompositions are discussed. the unconventional decomposition,
    if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module
    consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in
    most cases. an alternative approach to implementation which
    does not have this effect is sketched. december, 1972 parnas,

    <text>the user in librarianship curricula. extract from a
    postgraduate dissertation presented at ufmg library school,
    brazil. within the discipline of librarianship, user studies
    are an important research topic, but there is little systematic
    study of users in librarianship curricula. to establish how
    this important subject area should be treated in training
    programmes, an analysis was made of the literature dealing with
    users, to establish a theoretical basis for teaching purposes.
    results showed that the primary focus was on user behaviour in
    relation to social and cultural factors; needs and motivations;
    and interaction and communication in the library situation.
    accordingly, an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on, for
    example, psychology, anthropology and sociology, should be

    <text>abstraction mechanisms in clu clu is a new programming
    language designed to support the use of abstractions in program
    construction. work in programming methodology has led to the
    realization that three kinds of abstractions-procedural,
    control, and especially data abstractions-are useful in the
    programming process. of these, only the procedural abstraction
    is supported well by conventional languages, through the
    procedure or subroutine. clu provides, in addition to
    procedures, novel linguistic mechanisms that support the use of
    data and control abstractions. this paper provides an in
    troduction to the abstraction mechanisms in clu. by means of
    programming examples, the utility of the three kinds of
    abstractions in program construction is illustrated, and it is
    shown how clu programs may be written to use and implement
    abstractions. the clu library, which permits incremental
    program development with complete type checking performed at
    compile time, is also discussed. august, 1977 liskov, b.

    <text>backtrack programming techniques the purpose of this
    paper is twofold. first, a brief exposition of the general
    backtrack technique and its history is given. second, it is
    shown how the use of macros can considerably shorten the
    computation time in many cases. in particular, this technique
    has allowed the solution of two previously open combinatorial
    problems, the computation of new terms in a well-known series,
    and the substantial reduction in computation time for the
    solution to another combinatorial problem. november, 1975

    <text>efficient multiprogramming resource allocation and
    accounting although sometimes thought of as only a component of
    time-sharing operation, multiprogramming can involve broader
    questions of resource allocation, since fairness is not
    required to meet a response criterion. in a multiprogrammed
    system, it may serve maximal resource use to be unfair, for
    example by holding an input/output channel idle for a program
    while it completes a small amount of processor usage, enabling
    further use of the channel. several applications of this
    principle are given, and it is suggested that a
    multiprogramming executive might dynamically adjust its
    allocation algorithms to gain efficiency. allocation of
    resources is closely connected to accounting for those
    resources, raising the problems of repeatability, minimal
    uncharged overhead, and relative weighting of charges for
    dependent resources. since weightings may depend on allocation
    algorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting parameters.
    often the only repeatable accounting is one which omits an
    extensive overhead will be paid, and should multiprogramming
    prove efficient, overcharges will result. multiprogramming
    turns on allocation of the memory resource essential to control
    of other resources. the general suggestions for allocation and
    accounting are applied to this question, and some details
    provided for the case of a monitor which controls a
    virtual-memory machine. june, 1973 hamlet, r. g. monitor,

    more compact data representation and more efficient processing
    techniques; to take fuller advantage of possible available
    previous knowledge about the matrix. and it is designed as a
    structured program, which can readily be coded by the reader in
    the high level or low level programming language of his choice.
    practical tests of the method have shown it to be a good basis

    <text>the importance of teaching use of the library.
    introduction to an occasional series on use instructions in
    academic libraries. bibliographic instruction is teaching
    students how to find information efficiently and effectively in
    the modern library. instituting bibliographic instruction
    programmes permits students to do better work, to be more
    independent in their work and to have more motivation. this
    allows assignments to be more varied and expectations can be
    higher. bibliographic instruction also helps to insure that the
    collection is well used-an important argument when cost

    <text>a case study of a new code generation technique for
    compilers recent developments in optimizing techniques have
    allowed a new design for compilers to emerge. such a compiler
    translates the parsed source code into lower level code by a
    sequence of steps. each step expands higher level statements
    into blocks of lower level code and then performs optimizations
    on the result. each statement has only one possible
    expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take advantage of
    any special cases is done by the optimizations. this paper
    provides evidence that this strategy can indeed result in good
    object code. the traditionally difficult pl/i concatenate
    statement was investigated as a detailed example. a set of
    fairly simple optimizations was identified which allow the
    compiler to produce good code. more elaborate optimizations can
    further improve the object code. for most contexts of the
    concatenate statement, the code produced by a compiler using
    the expansion-optimization strategy described above compares
    favorably with the code produced by a conventional pl/i
    optimizing compiler. december, 1977 carter, j. l. compiler

    <text>operations on sparse relations various computations on

    computation of precedence relations for a context-free grammar,
    can be done by a practical algorithm that is asymptotically
    faster than those in common use. for example, how to compute
    operator precedence or wirth-weber precedence relations in
    o(n^2) steps is shown, as well as how to compute linear
    precedence functions in o(n^2) steps is shown, as well as how
    to compute linear precedence functions in o(n) steps, where n
    is the size of a grammer. the heart of the algorithms is a
    general theorem giving sufficient conditions under which an
    expression whose operands are sparse relations and whose

    inverse, can be computed efficiently. march, 1977 hunt, h. b.

    august library in wolfenbuttel, feb 81. for years librarians
    have argued over the relationships between pure librarianship
    and administration in their work, which are particularly

    librarians feel themselves to be inadequately represented when
    questions on university staffing arise and should strive for
    better coordination. administration is not part of the academic
    discipline of librarianship and close links must be established
    between this discipline and the academic librarian.

    <text>communication today and tomorrow; (electronics in the

    provision has undergone 4 phases' (1) stock formation; (2)
    automation of library and information processes; (3)
    information flow and intensive stock growth; (4) development of
    electronic communication. the combination of electronic
    teletype with video terminals facilitated information
    transmission. the telefax equipment transmits a facsimile of
    the information along a telephone network. the 'electronic
    post' transmits communications from one person to another.
    systems have evolved for transmitting information onto domestic
    tv screens. utilisation of tv channels facilitated the creation
    of automated systems providing information to a wide circle of
    consumers. closed-circuit tv systems permit libraries to
    disseminate information selectively. recently videorecordings,
    using high information capacity disk videoplayers, have been
    introduced into libraries.</text>

    centre's tasks include' providing advice and practical help for
    library development; providing help with technical problems;
    organising basic and advanced training for professional and
    non-professional staff; administering church and public funds
    for the libraries; representing church library interests within
    religious and public spheres; providing theological material
    and establishing the library's role in the community. a state

    <text>regional bibliographies. in accordance with the dynamic

    turned to regional and local problems recently. members of the
    governing bodies must therefore be kept abreast of the latest
    information on their regions to be able to run their economy
    smoothly and to pursue the correct cultural and other policies.
    thus departments of local history in libraries, and those in
    the central district libraries in particular, have the duty and
    responsibility to build up appropriate bibliographic resources.
    in addition to books, daily papers and periodicals, non-book
    materials such as records, tapes, documentary films, slides,
    photos and picture postcards have become rather significant. as
    to contents, materials have to be sifted very carefully to give

    <text>library work with the elderly and handicapped. bonn
    public library service for senior citizens and the housebound
    was created 15 years ago. it is organised by the librarian of a
    branch library specialising in large print material and
    programmes of activities for the elderly. the librarian visits
    all prospective readers to find out their requirements; close
    personal contact between staff and readers is essential. each
    of the 180 readers is visited once in every 4 weeks, when books
    are issued, renewed or returned within a specially simplified
    system. the branch library supplies about 80% of the stock and
    publishes an annual list of large print books held. the main
    problem for these readers is poor sight so large print books
    are essential; books should also not be heavy since some
    readers have difficulty holding them.</text>

    <text>the design and implementation of a table driven,
    interactive diagnostic programming system caps is a highly
    interactive diagnostic compiler/interpreter that allows
    beginning programmers to prepare, debug, and execute fairly
    simple programs at a graphics display terminal. complete syntax
    checking and most semantic analysis is performed as the program
    is entered and as it is subsequently edited. analysis is
    performed character by character. the most remarkable feature
    of caps is its ability to automatically diagnose errors both at
    compile time and at run time. errors are not automatically
    corrected. instead, caps interacts with the student to help him
    find the cause of his error. most components of caps are table
    driven, both to reduce the space needed for implementation and
    to increase the flexibility of the multilingual system. over
    500 students have used caps to learn fortran, pl/i, or cobolin
    conjunction with a computer assisted course on introductory

    <text>research, literature, and a rich marriage. library
    historical portraits (2). a portrait of peter frederik suhm,

    library in his house in central copenhagen to the public and
    people from all spheres of life used it. little is known of
    this library as catalogues, correspondence, invoices and
    records of borrowings were lost. although 1 of suhm's
    librarians, r. nyerup, was a prolific author, he never wrote
    about the library. with 100,000 volumes, it was larger than the
    university library. suhm spent 5 times as much on his library
    as the government spent on the royal library, not yet open to
    the public, and paid for it with his wealthy wife's money. 2
    years before his death the library was sold to the royal

    <text>use of foreign language literature in cereals research.
    the use and effect of foreign language literature on cereals
    research in nigeria was determined by using a multi-method
    approach. english language and indigenous african language
    literature was excluded. languages included were french,
    german, spanish, russian, japanese and chinese. methods used in
    the survey were a two-year analysis of the loans records of the
    national cereals research institute library, questionnaires
    distributed to research scientists and analyses of the foreign
    language references in recent publications and theses of the
    scientists. results showed that scientists make little use of
    foreign language literature because few of them are able to
    read these languages. consequently scientists are missing
    important information and there is duplication of research
    which use of foreign language literature could minimise.
    results also showed that french, german, chinese and japanese
    are important in cereals research.</text>

    <text>sdi in an academic community. a 6-month experimental sdi
    service was undertaken at the university of natal library,
    pietermaritzburg south africa, as part of a plan to make
    subject librarians more service orientated, and in the
    knowledge that research time for academics was at a premium. a
    methodology was devised and 21 lecturers from across the
    academic spectrum submitted 27 profiles. references were
    supplied from journals and monographs and from abstracting
    tools where the library had poor literature coverage. at the
    end of the 6 months, feedback revealed that 93% of the
    references assessed (82%) were relevant or apparently relevant,
    showing that bibliographic rather than terminological skills
    were the salient factor. academic response was unanimously in
    favour of a continuation of the service, while a few
    respondents wanted minor improvements. the subject librarians
    found that the service increased job satisfaction and allowed
    them to look more critically at library stock. in terms of time
    and financial cost the sdi service was easily absorbed into the
    existing work structure of the library. it was found to be
    particularly relevant to interdisciplinary research, and it
    relied upon a well-developed subject librarian structure. its
    success, however, depended on an active campaign by librarians

    <text>unified rules on keyword cataloguing. lecture given at
    the annual conference of the verein der bibliothekare an
    offentlichen bibliotheken (association of librarians in public
    libraries) west germany, may 81. librarians have been
    discussing the idea of unified keyword cataloguing rules for
    over 50 years and the subject cataloguing committee of the
    deutsches bibliotheksinstitut (german library institute) has
    recently produced a report on this subject. since subject
    cataloguing problems have been neglected for decades and
    subject cataloguing carried out by many individual libraries
    has resulted in the wasting of work time, super-regional
    cooperation in this sphere offers attractive prospects. if
    regional union catalogue systems and centralised services took
    over all subject cataloguing, rational rules and procedures
    would result. keyword catalogues are becoming more and more
    popular and the creation of unified rules will demand more
    intensive work by librarians.</text>

    <text>display procedures although the use of structured display
    files is widespread in interactive computer graphics, these
    structures present a number of problems which tend to restrict
    their generality and usefulness. this paper discusses some of
    these problems, and suggests an alternative approach to display
    system design which avoids the use of structured display files.
    this technique employs display procedures to generate
    information for display. by including transformations within
    calls to these procedures it is possible both to simplify the
    specification of pictures and to speed up their generation.
    display procedures permit picture elements to be defined
    conditionally and also facilitate the processing of inputs from
    pointing devices. the paper is illustrated by examples from
    aversion of the euler language in which display procedures were
    implemented. october, 1971 newman, w. m. computer graphics,

    <text>microfiche as a vehicle for technical reports. the
    national institute of justice is interested in the possibility
    of improving the cost effectiveness of their information
    dissemination programme by making a larger part of the
    dissemination in microfiche instead of paper copy. they
    commissioned this study on an interagency agreement to help
    them decide whether microfiche dissemination would have the
    desired effect. the report concludes that, as presently used,
    most of the advantages of microfiche accrue to the producer,
    and most of the disadvantages to the user. there is likely to
    be considerable resistance to broadening the use of fiche for
    the intended audience of criminal justice professionals.
    several alternatives are presented for lessening this problem,
    including emphasis on the role of libraries, promoting the
    availability of fiche-to-paper copiers, and using microfiche
    itself in innovative ways to facilitate information transfer,
    rather than as an attempt to duplicate the features o f a paper

    last year were made but staff are catching up on the

    library must play a key role in university planning. because of
    processing, storage and running costs, each book costs more
    than its purchasing price; the use of electronic data
    processing will not save much money but will improve services.

    <text>sources of antagonism to 'qualitative' research.
    contribution to an issue on the application of qualitative
    approaches to the study of information problems. considers why
    quantitative methods are believed to be more 'scientific',
    rigorous, and valid than qualitative ones and argues that the
    term 'qualitative' is applied to different aspects of research
    which are sufficiently independent of each other to make the
    quantitative/qualitative distinction artificial. suggests that
    criticisms of qualitative research are 'ideological in the
    sense that they give support to existing institutions wherein
    some classes or groups (research sponsors) try to exert control
    over others'. typical criticisms of such research are analysed
    to expose the nature of the underlying expressions of

    <text>the later development of christ church library, oxford.
    books were first transferred to the new christ church library
    building in peckwater quadrangle in the period 1763-70. the
    post of library keeper was filled by a senior member of the
    college. initially the library only served senior members of
    the college. in 1869 a library committee was established to
    oversee the purchase of books and the compiling and updating of
    catalogues. an undergraduate reading room was set up apart from
    the main building in 1884 and existed until 1929. problems
    arising from inefficiency and a lack of space gave rise to a
    major reorganisation of the library's resources in the 1930s.
    at the present time new accessions currently run to about 900
    volumes and 160 pamphlets per annum. all members of the college
    now have access to the library which has the best stock of
    research material in oxford, apart from the bodleian.</text>

    <text>an energy-conscious library building in katwijk. on 14

    netherlands. during the planning stages it was felt that a
    building with a public function, such as a public library,
    should set an example in energy saving. to maximise natural
    energy from the sun the building has been constructed with a
    large area of glass in the south-east wall; the warmth
    generated by this means is retained in the stone north wall and
    the floor. the building is equipped with triple-glazing and
    heat-insulating blinds which close automatically at night and
    reopen each morning. it is expected that the savings in energy
    costs will be in the region of 50%. it is to be hoped that
    other libraries in the netherlands will follow this
    example.</text>

    <text>performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by
    deterministic simulation simulation is presented as a practical
    technique for performance evaluation of alternative
    configurations of highly concurrent computers. a technique is
    described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation
    model of a system. in the model a control stream replaces the
    instruction and data streams of the real system. simulation of
    the system model yields the timing and resource usage
    statistics needed for performance evaluation, without the
    necessity of emulating the system. as a case study, the
    implementation of a simulator of a model of the cpu-memory
    subsystem of the ibm 360/91 is described. the results of
    evaluating some alternative system designs are discussed. the
    experiments reveal that, for the case study, the major
    bottlenecks in the system are the memory unit and the fixed
    point unit. further, it appears that many of the sophisticated
    pipelining and buffering technique simplemented in the
    architecture of the ibm 360/91 are of little value when
    high-speed (cache) memory is used, as in the ibm 360/195.

    has become a commonplace. that flow, however, was disrupted
    during world war ii, when an emergency supply system was set up
    by the usa to replace nonfunctioning book trade channels. the
    federal governments' interdepartmental committee for the
    acquisition of foreign publications (idc) operated by the
    office of strategic services (oss), collected foreign journals
    overseas in order to reproduce them on microfilm and distribute
    them to government agencies, one of which was the library of
    congress. in late 1942 the office of the alien property
    custodian (apc) was urged to seize the copyrights of the
    leading european periodicals and to reprint and distribute
    them. describes this republication programme in detail and

    purposes should be considered; their usefulness will vary from

    uk, feasibility studies were followed by the setting up of
    transport schemes in a number of the uk library regions, and a
    national scheme linking the regions was envisaged. transport
    schemes were not considered worthwhile in the larger regions
    with less interlending activity. a methodology for setting up
    schemes has been devised. the present transport schemes are

    <text>computing capabilities at western european universities
    this report on the author's trip to universities in western
    europe in the summer of 1966 gives brief descriptions of
    computing activities at each institution visited. present
    equipment capabilities vary from moderate to large scale;
    however, many institutions plan to acquire complex time-shared
    systems in the near future. in the author's opinion, the state
    of the art lags behind that on this continent. this lag is
    attributed to four principal factors: (a) the handicapping
    organization of academic procedures; (b) the
    university-government financial relationship; (c) the
    subordinated organization of the computing facility; (d) the
    paucity of professional interchange of knowledge. the effects

    <text>on charging for information services. comments on a
    report by the delegation for scientific and technical
    information provision' 2information at any price' on charging
    for information services1, in which it is suggested that
    interlending from scientific libraries should be charged at a
    standard rate per loan, despite the fact that charging for
    traditional library services was excluded from the commission's
    remit. 1 reason for considering charges nonetheless is the
    increasing scope and cost of interlending. another is the
    change in the budgeting of institutions for tertiary education
    which has transferred library allocations from the state to the
    institutions; these are tempted to achieve savings through
    charges on interlending. the report regards interlending of
    little importance to public libraries. it does not attempt to
    calculate the cost of interlending, nor the cost of

    <text>an approach to the potential importance of information in
    engineering. following a previous study concerned with the
    monitoring of information flow, aims to assess the potential
    value of information in the prosecution of engineering
    projects. for each of 3 projects the background of potentially
    useful information was explored and compared with the
    information actually being used. in general no vast amount of
    immediately useful information was found, much of the
    information used deriving from the individual engineer's own
    training and resources. the information flow was regarded as
    adequate for the practical purposes of the projects. however,
    awareness of research information potentially useful for the
    long range planning was limited, the main obstacles to
    information flow of this type being management attitudes and
    organisational constraints.</text>

    interlibrary loan, union catalogue, union lists, cooperative
    cataloguing, and telecommunications networks between 2
    countries and over a large and sparsely populated region.
    networking has resulted in increased services to library users
    and in increased efficiencies in library operations. it has
    also introduced a whole set of new problems that must be
    discussed in the forum provided as a result of the cooperative

    <text>automatic data structure selection: an example and
    overview the use of several levels of abstraction has proved to
    be very helpful in constructing and maintaining programs. when
    programs are designed with abstract data types such as sets and
    lists, programmer time can be saved by automating the process
    of filling in low-level implementation details. in the past,
    programming systems have provided only a single general purpose
    implementation for an abstract type. thus the programs produced
    using abstract types were then inefficient in space or time. in
    this paper a system for automatically choosing efficient
    implementations for abstract types from a library of
    implementations is discussed. this process is discussed in
    detail for an example program. general issues in data structure
    selection are also reviewed. may, 1978 low, j.r. abstract data

    also other publications now not normally found in bookshops.

    facilities in a normal school. during the early 20th century, a
    change took place which affected teacher education as much as
    it did other disciplines. education library collections
    developed, education library services expanded to meet a
    growing demand. education librarians began to hold national
    meetings and to debate questions of standards, both
    quantitative and qualitative. throughout its brief history,
    education librarianship seems to have been caught between the

    <text>pictorial pattern recognition and the phase problem of
    x-ray crystallography the availability of interactive,
    three-dimensional, computer graphics systems coupled to
    powerful digital computers encourages the development of
    algorithms adapted to this environment. pictorial pattern
    recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches to
    x-ray structure determination based on molecular model
    building, i.e. the use of chemical information to frame
    "structural hypotheses" which can computationally be tested and
    refined by reference to the experimental data. application of
    standard pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
    that the cross-correlation between a model and the correct
    structure cannot be computed because of a fundamental
    incompleteness in the measured data. however, it is possible to
    compute an upper bound to such a cross-correlation. a simple
    example demonstrates that this information can be the basis of
    a technique for structure determination that can make effective
    use of an interactive graphics system. model building by
    cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages over usual
    crystallographic techniques based on the autocorrelation or
    patterson function, especially for large structures. this is
    significant, for crystallography of biological macromolecules
    hasbeen and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

    of australia queensland branch and college libraries section,
    university of queensland, brisbane, 27-29 aug 80. its aim was
    to focus the attention of both policy-makers and practitioners
    on the role of interlending in the provision of information
    services during the next few years. the programme was directed
    1st at the current situation with regard to patterns of

    <text>the semantic problems of translated subject headings.
    study of the problems inherent in the translation of subject
    headings from english into korean. 4 different semantic
    entities are involved-the english of the original list, the
    classification numbers, and the korean translation list which
    must use both chinese ideograms and the korean alphabet.
    ultimately the classification number serves as the most
    accurate guide to the semantic content of the original term, as
    well as a guide to the most suitable term to express this in
    the language of the adaptation.</text>

    <text>the specification of the properties of the thermistor as
    a circuit element in very low frequency systems an analysis
    based on sinusoidal applied voltages shows that a conductor
    whose resistance is a function of temperature may be
    represented by an equivalent circuit having a semicircular
    impedance locus an expression for the distortion of the
    waveform is also obtained and this is found to be small
    provided that the alternating current is less than a quarter of
    t steady polarizing current which flows in the conductor the
    impedance loci of a bead type thermistor are plotted by means
    of null technique a typical impedance varied from a negative
    resistance of at very low frequencies to a pure inductance of
    and then to a positive resistance of at high frequencies the
    use of the equivalent circuit is illustrated by designing phase
    shift networks suitable for use in the stabilizing of very low

    multiple functions (up to 14) are produced for long periods of
    time (up to several hours) at sufficiently high sampling rates
    to describe fast human reactions (up to 200 samples per
    second). the functions can be used for a variety of purposes
    such as the control of machine tools or sound synthesizers or
    anything a person normally controls. the program operates on a
    small computer (ddp-224). functions are stored on a disk file.
    functions may be created by real-time human inputs to the
    computer which can interact with already stored functions and
    computed functions. real-time feedback from the process being
    controlled is an important link in the system. the environment
    for effective man-machine interaction has been carefully

    catalogues, the collections include prespectuses, technical
    information leaflets, technical specifications, pricelists,
    production programmes, works bulletins, company reports and the

    headed by the state scientific and technical library of the
    ussr, where the bulletin 2new industrial catalogues1,
    containing 19 series, is published twice a month. its
    industrial catalogues' collection is made up of 100,000 items.

    <text>improved event-scanning mechanisms for discrete event
    simulation simulation models of large, complex "real-world"
    applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating
    up hours of computer time. this problem may be attributed in
    part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence.
    however, an additional problem lies in the fact that a
    significant amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep
    future events in their proper sequence. this paper presents a
    method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning
    future event lists in discrete event simulations. there models
    are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness as the
    events-list scan problem becomes more burdensome. june, 1975

    <text>simulation of traffic flows in a network a computer
    simulation program which deals with traffic flows in the

    into blocks of several ten-meter lengths and is represented by
    a bidirectional list in computer memory. the movement of cars,
    i.e. the transfer of cars from one block to the next, is
    expressed by a proper formula. this formula is based on the
    supposition that the speed of cars in a block is determined
    only by the density of cars in the block, and this
    speed-versus-density curve is empirically given the numerical
    values. this simulation scheme has its excellent point in that
    it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behavior of traffic

    library classification represents the foundation of systematic
    catalogues and plays an important part in subject cataloguing.
    its form relating to content and ideology depends on the level
    of development of the sciences and society which it reflects.
    it is necessary to study it from an historical point of view.
    through studying the subjects library classification and
    subject cataloguing students are enabled to understand the
    methodological basis of library classification and to evaluate
    it from a marxist-leninist point of view. this is also relevant
    in the case of terminology for a subject catalogue or a
    thesaurus. students are informed about all aspects of subject
    cataloguing and follow the development of library
    classification from the end of the 15th century to the present
    situation in east germany. they are made aware of the need to
    involve themselves in the present and future development of

    discusses the meaning of collection development in the 1980s
    and the fiscal adversities facing east asian collections in the
    usa (inflation, budget cuts, dramatic increases in costs of
    east asian books and postage rates, nd increased danger of cuts
    in under-utilised collections such as those specialising in
    east asia). suggests strategies (specialisation, cooperation,
    sharing checklists of unique holdings, reduction of
    duplication, and optimal use of new technology) and describes
    the preparations for future development made by the east asian
    collection of the hoover institution, stanford university,

    <text>the future of the book' a historian's perspective.
    examines the future of the book in the academic library using a
    historical approach. its thesis is that there will be both
    continuity with the past and breaks with tradition, and that
    both forces will impact the future library. it distinguishes
    between cumulative and noncumulative knowledge and basic and
    applied research and concludes that knowledge in certain
    disciplines is best communicated using the traditional
    print-on-paper format, while communication of knowledge in
    other disciplines is likely to incorporate the newer

    <text>the importance of cooperation for the utilisation of

    pharmaceutical institutions are not provided with special
    literature. their libraries and book collections belong to the
    medical library network, but they are the 'stepchildren' of the
    network, and do not utilise advantages to be expected from
    cooperation. conditions in budapest are more favourable than
    elsewhere in hungary, as pharmacists can visit the network
    centres, the hungarian technical library and the library of the
    hungarian academy of sciences. elsewhere, pharmacists can only
    rely on a small amount of available literature. recommends
    improvements in acquisitions, and interlibrary loans through
    the development of library cooperation, and discusses a data
    bank established by the hungarian national institute of
    pharmaceutics, which holds information on foreign drug
    compounds, their producers, indications and counterindications,
    side-effects, and possible hungarian equivalents.</text>

    <text>computers as an innovation in american local governments
    computers and electronic data processing are a major
    technological innovation in the operations of american local
    government. this paper establishes that there is substantial
    variation among the larger local governments in the rate at
    which they adopt computer technology, in the level of financial
    support they provide for edp, and in the extensiveness and
    sophistication of their automated applications. the central
    question addressed is: what might explain the differences
    between governments in the extent to which they adopt and use
    computers? hypotheses are tested for several streams of
    explanatory factors, using data from more than 500 city and
    county governments. the findings identify certain local
    government milieus which are particularly conducive to higher
    levels of computer innovation. somewhat unexpected findings
    reveal the significant impact of the distribution of control
    over edp decisions and the dominant political values within the
    government. other important factors include the measured need
    for computer applications and the presence of external funding
    support for computing. finally, the paper suggests a framework
    for identifying the key determinants of other technological
    innovations. december, 1977 danziger, j. n. dutton, w. h.

    <text>group processing of literature. large libraries are
    always trying to reduce the size of their catalogues and, at
    the same time, to simplify the retrieval of individual indexed
    items. the bulk of library stock must be indexed individually,
    however, there is a certain type of literature, such as
    information leaflets, promotional literature, which is suitable
    for group processing (1 catalogue card is used for a series of
    items for example). the main library of leningrad polytechnic
    prepared 'instructions for group processing of information
    literature' in 1977. the implementation of these instructions
    is discussed. it is shown that group processing of certain
    types of literature can considerably increase the effectiveness
    of cataloguing, decrease labour consumption and reduce the size

    <text>new trends in librarianship and information science
    studies. the department of librarianship and information
    science at the faculty of philosophy within the comenius
    university in bratislava has been in existence for 30 years. at
    present, both full-time and part-time undergraduate and
    postgraduate courses are offered. in accordance with the new
    ideas in the czechoslovak system of higher education, curricula
    has recently been subjected to profound and sometimes
    controversial changes. the duration of undergraduate courses
    has been reduced from 5 to 4 years. it will concentrate on
    librarianship and/or information science as well as on closely
    related subjects. the aim of equipping students with the basic
    knowledge in the field of their prospective type of library has
    been abandoned. although it fell short of expectations, the
    extension of the department's building will nevertheless enable
    the teaching and other staff to build up resources of
    audio-visual aids and other illustrative materials, and also to
    involve their students in research projects.</text>

    circulation decrease and a 136% increase in photocopying.
    differences between prediction and results may be accounted for
    by the effect of duplicate copy subscriptions and by provision

    <text>the bibliographic situation and the national periodical
    catalogue, (part) 2' the long approach. the need for a national
    periodical catalogue for public libraries has long been felt by
    reference librarians. the need was partly fulfilled in 1970
    when the public libraries in greater copenhagen published a
    catalogue of their periodical holdings. in the provinces
    coverage is very uneven and with growth in interlending the
    need for a union catalogue is now acute. the bibliographic
    joint committee is now considering a project on such a
    catalogue and has asked the library centre to prepare an
    editorial plan for input of bibliographic data into its data
    base. it now appears that input cannot begin for financial
    reasons until 1 jan 84. appeals to the library inspectorate to

    <text>does current affairs documentation increase library use?.
    in modern society where people wish to participate in the
    decision-making process it is essential that the public have
    access through libraries to information on all matters
    affecting their lives. for this purpose collections of material
    relating to matters of current, social concern should be formed
    in local libraries. however, material of this nature is often
    difficult to obtain and to organise. in addition, since the
    useful life of such material is often short, the librarian must
    ensure through careful publicity that the collection is used as
    heavily as possible. in the netherlands the nederlands
    bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and
    literature) plans to organise a meeting in 1982 for librarians
    to discuss the organisation and exploitation of such
    collections in public libraries.</text>

    colleges and universities sponsoring elderhostel (a programme
    for adults aged over 60, offered on many campuses) for at least
    2 years during 1977-79. the 197 replies containing usable data
    indicated that the librarians disagreed with stereotypic
    statements concerning older adults; contact with older adult
    relatives was not a significant factor in the librarians'
    responses to the statements; implementing library programmes
    for older adults was a significant factor in librarians'
    agreement with suggested library services for older adults,
    while planning programmes for them was less significant and
    volunteer community work was not a significant factor; and
    librarians felt that age is not necessarily a debilitative
    factor with regard to learning and motivation to learn.</text>

    comprise a basic structure of a central library containing 2/3
    of stock, plus some subject libraries, containing the remaining
    1/3. together they operate a union catalogue and in this they
    have recently been joined by the roman catholic university of
    eichstatt. the catalogue, containing over 2 million main
    entries, is used in interlibrary loans, bibliographic work,
    cataloguing, stock selection and information services.

    <text>the future of catalogers and cataloging. the past few
    years have seen many changes in the cataloguing departments of
    us research libraries. reduced budgets, less emphasis on
    perfection, greater use of library assistants, standardisation,
    and automation have had a profound effect upon the professional
    responsibility of cataloguers. if current trends continue,
    future emphasis will be on the sharing of high quality
    bibliographic records through a national network. as the amount
    of original cataloguing decreases, the cataloguer of the future
    will more likely be a manager with responsibility for the
    library's bibliographic control system. only in larger research
    institutions will a significant amount of original cataloguing
    remain. another possible scenario will be the disappearance of
    cataloguers as public and technical services staff merge into
    integrated subject units.</text>

    infoterra (international referral system for sources of

    nations environment programme as part of earthwatch, its
    programme for the critical assessment of the global
    environment. in operation since jan 77, it has a decentralised
    structure and its national, regional and sectorial focal points
    and the infoterra programme activity centre act as
    switchboards, connecting users with appropriate information
    sources or (if their resources allow) sometimes providing
    information directly to the user. infoterra is not a
    substantive information system and does not provide documents.
    after initial hostility towards the system, developing
    countries are now major participants and infoterra is
    encouraging and helping them to establish their own national

    for the business world. examines on-line systems in english
    public libraries on the basis of visits in connection with a
    conference on on-line information in public libraries held in
    sept 81. luton central library has found that availability of
    on-line search methods has increased use of their reference
    service by businessmen and hospital medical staff in
    particular. hertfordshire county library installed a terminal
    in 1975 and carried out on-line searches; as a result it was
    able to cancel subscriptions to some reference works. in 1981
    it acquired an scl microcomputer for accession and issue
    control. birmingham central library has a terminal in the
    technical reference room, with access by all departments, but
    not the public. it regards the on-line service only as an
    additional reference tool. none of the libraries undertook
    computer searches of their own stock, but only in international
    data bases. librarians found that search effic iency increased
    if users were interviewed first, but not present during the
    actual search, and that those carrying out the search should be
    experienced reference librarians specialising in a particular
    base. raises the question of the effect on publication of
    reference works in paper editions of the growth of on-line
    search facilities. (for part 1 2see bibliotek 70 1(17) 1981,

    books and information literature published by the central
    institute of librarianship as a basis to improve their
    information activity. this list includes all general reference
    literature such as encyclopaedias, dictionaries, statutes, and
    the works of marx, engels and lenin. it is also important to
    keep the collection of information material up to date with
    current parliamentary reports, conference reports, and
    territorial literature such as town guides and other maps.
    trade union literature should also be available in public
    libraries. librarians should improve information activi ties to
