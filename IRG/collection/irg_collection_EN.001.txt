    <text>using synthetic images to register real images with
    surface models a number of image analysis tasks can benefit
    from registration of the image with a model of the surface
    being imaged. automatic navigation using visible light or radar
    images requires exact alignment of such images with digital
    terrain models. in addition, automatic classification of
    terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to
    deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and
    surface slope. even inspection techniques for certain
    industrial parts may be improved by this means. we achieve the
    required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic
    image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the
    light sources. the synthetic image intensity is calculated
    using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing
    surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. we
    illustrate the technique using landsat images and digital
    terrain models. november, 1978 horn, b.k.p. bachman, b.l. image

    <text>training library assistants in mauritius. the university

    development research centre of canada (idrc) embarked on a 15
    month experimental course in 1978 for the training of library
    assistants who were already working in libraries. the main aim
    of the experiment was to evolve a course of approximately 1
    year taking 3 afternoons weekly, geared to local conditions and
    using available resources. the experiment was a success and the
    course, after minor alterations, was continued in 1981.</text>

    <text>experiments in text file compression a system for the
    compression of data files, viewed as strings of characters, is
    presented. the method is general, and applies equally well to
    english, to pl/i, or to digital data. the system consists of an
    encoder, an analysis program, and a decoder. two algorithms for
    encoding a string differ slightly from earlier proposals. the
    analysis program attempts to find an optimal set of codes for
    representing substrings of the file. four new algorithms for
    this operation are described and compared. various parameters
    in the algorithms are optimized to obtain a high degree of
    compression for sample texts. november, 1976 rubin, f. text

    company, a composite insurance company dealing in all classes
    of insurance. for legal reasons paper records are important,
    since, although microfilm is accepted by courts, the evidence
    on it may not be accepted. use of microfilm to save space in
    keeping records has to be simple and cost-effective. a pilot
    scheme was launched at 5 branches, using 16 of the largest and
    most suitable tabulations for microfilm. a report on problems
    in the use of microfilm was produced, highlighting resistance
    to change, and criticisms of the microreader. a modified front
    projection reader was obtained and was received with much
    acclaim. the conversion of computer tabulated output to com is
    reaching its conclusion, and the company is now looking at

    <text>numerical properties of the ritz-trefftz algorithm for
    optimal control in this paper the ritz-trefftz algorithm is
    applied to the computer solution of the state regulator
    problem. the algorithm represents a modification of the ritz
    direct method and is designed to improve the speed of solution
    and the storage requirements to the point where real-time
    implementation becomes feasible. the modification is shown to
    be more stable computationally than the traditional ritz
    approach. the first concern of the paper is to describe the
    algorithm and establish its properties as a valid and useful
    numerical technique. in particular such useful properties as
    definiteness and reasonableness of condition are established
    for the method. the second part of the paper is devoted to a
    comparison of the new techniques with the standard procedure of
    numerically integrating a matrix riccati equation to determine
    a feedback matrix. the new technique is shown to be
    significantly faster for comparable accuracy. june, 1971

    <text>recommendations for constructing regional network systems

    constructing regional network systems and building up regional
    library centres were put forward by the sub-committee on data
    processing in conjunction with the library committee of the
    german research society (deutche forschungsgemeinschaft). they
    underline how necessary and urgent it is to build up regional
    data processing networks for cooperative cataloguing in
    libraries. regional networks provide the optimal means of
    rationalising library work. these networks should not be
    constructed in all 11 federal states but should be built up on
    the existing 7 lending system regions; they would all be
    connected in a national network. regional library centres would
    form the national network and would have the following general
    task areas' cataloguing and acquisition, central editing of
    catalogues etc., data exchange with other central institutes
    and networks, supplying ordered boo ks within the planned
    national order system, developing systems and programmes for
    the software of the regional network, and planning and

    <text>third time lucky in putting patients first?. the (uk)
    national health service is to be reorganised in 1982 for the
    third time since the war. the 1974 concept of the health care
    district as a health care community is to be the starting point
    of the next reorganisation and many multi-district areas are to
    be split, amalgamated or regrouped. librarians have developed
    library services of the nhs as an information network, and much
    of the country is now covered by regional networks
    incorporating nhs and medical school libraries. the new
    district health authorities may disrupt or cut services
    altogether, nhs fails frequently to recognise the direct
    contribution of library services to quality health care, and
    some libraries could come under the administrators of
    individual hospitals, although both the library association and
    nhs regional librarians group advocate organisation on a
    district rather than an institutional basis. librarians must be
    seen to be contributing to health care and actively campaign

    sequentially in memory, rather than chained with pointers.
    since this is not always convenient, the swym system permits a
    list to be chained, compact, or any combination of the two. a
    description is given of that list representation and the
    operators implemented (most are similar to those of lisp 1.5).
    the system garbage collector attempts to make all lists
    compact; it relocates and rearranges all of list storage using
    temporary storage. this unique list-compacting garbage

    <text>are county libraries threatened?. the norwegian
    government report nou 1979 proposes that from 1981 state grants
    towards county administration should cease, being replaced by
    additional tax income. the intention is to simplify local
    government financial structure and increase the counties'
    administrative responsibility and autonomy. concentrating on
    technical details, the report ignores their effect on
    professions and employment in the areas concerned. cultural
    work is defined as a voluntary activity for counties, not
    requiring or meriting state support; libraries are considered
    to be already under some degree of state supervision. state
    support has been a stimulus to cultural life in rural areas,
    and its removal would be a retrograde step. the proposals, if
    implemented without further clarification of laws, regulations
    and areas of responsibility, could lead to greatly varying
    standards of library service in individual counties, also
    affecting schools and adult education. this would be di rectly

    in the netherlands cooperation amongst libraries of all types
    has come under close examination as a result of the inclusion
    of public library services in the proposed public services act.
    the concept of library networks dates from the early 1900s when
    the need for libraries to share their resources was recognised.
    the most effective library networks are those networks which
    operate their services on a financial basis. in addition, the
    coordination of acquisition policies, cataloguing services and
    interlibrary lending amongst members of a library network
    requires the most up-to-date telecommunication and computer
    equipment. within each network a central library should be
    designated to act as a clearing-house for the transfer of
    information.</text>

    <text>on-line, new aid in reference work. reports on an
    international conference on on-line information in public
    libraries organised by the british library research and
    development department and held in sept. 81. a number of
    british public libraries have during the last 3 years carried
    out experiments with the use of on-line systems. results of
    these have been published in the british library's report
    series and were discussed at the conference. the question of
    payment for on-line searches was debated. the experience in
    other countries was outlined, including the one from gentofte,
    denmark. in luton central library, england, which formerly
    subscribed to only a few conventional bibliographic services,
    installation of on-line facilities has led to a large
    expansion. new users have been attracted, the library's image
    improved, and the ensuing good-will has been a useful tool in
    the fight against cuts. the staff have become more cost
    conscious and hence more careful in dealing with users, who
    have been more thoroughly interviewed. more time is now spent
    preparing the search strategy. the danger of redundancies as a
    result of greater efficiency was therefore dismissed.</text>

    <text>towards an alternative regional approach to libraries. in
    the netherlands a change in government policy towards the
    provision of regional library services is now becoming
    apparent. in the government's view the increasing availability
    of on-line information retrieval services will necessitate the
    creation of a network of well-stocked libraries in each region.
    in order to finance such a policy whilst local authorities are
    suffering severe economic restraints, the government has
    suggested that less attention should be given to the
    recreational function of public libraries. in addition,
    research by the bibliotheekraad (library advisory council) into
    interlibrary lending in the netherlands has shown that there is
    insufficient cooperation on acquisition policies amongst the
    libraries of each region. in order to bring libraries together
    in closer cooperation it will be necessary to overcome the
    resistance of individual librarians and to change the present
    law relating to public libraries.</text>

    ralph waldo emerson with formulating the basic concept of

    consciousness of the need of users to understand libraries.
    considers the importance of early 20th century experiments with
    library user instruction, and reviews some of the conflicts
    which emerged as stronger assertations were made in favour of
    this instruction. argues that there is a continuing lack of

    <text>a relational model of data for large shared data banks
    future users of large data banks must be protected from having
    to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal
    representation). a prompting service which supplies such
    information is not a satisfactory solution. activities of users
    at terminals and most application programs should remain
    unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed
    and even when some aspects of the external representation are
    changed. change in data representation will often be needed as
    a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and
    natural growth in the types of stored information. existing
    noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with
    tree-structured files or slightly more general network models
    of the data. in section 1, inadequacies of these models are
    discussed. a model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for
    data base relations, and the concept of a universal form for
    data base relations, and the concept of a universal data
    sublanguage are introduced. in section 2, certain operations on

    <text>experiments with an automatic theorem-prover
    havingpartial ordering inference rules automatic
    theorem-provers need to be made much more efficient. with this
    in mind, slagle has shown how the axioms for partial ordering
    can be replaced by built-in inference rules when using a
    particular theorem-proving algorithm based upon
    hyper-resolution and paramodulation. the new rules embody the
    transitivity of partial orderings and the close relationship
    between predicates. a program has been developed using a
    modified version of these rules. this new theorem-prover has
    been found to be very powerful for solving problems involving
    partial orderings. this paper presents a detailed description
    of the program and a comprehensive account of the experiments
    that have been performed with it. november, 1973 slagle, j. r.

    development in all fields of librarianship, currently through
    its programmes universal bibliographic control and universal
    availability of publications was emphasised. access to
    information is essential for a country's social and economic
    development, final responsibility for this resting with the
    government. while the year of the child must be followed up
    especially in developing countries, the year of the disabled is
    a reminder that handicapped people in all countries lack equal
    opportunities with other reading groups. worldwide economic
    difficulties must not inhibit the search for new ideas.
    challenges all library organisations to focus attention in 1981
    particularly on the library need of blind and other handicapped
    readers.</text>

    <text>rationalisation and cooperation in collection development
    in australia. describes the difficulties imposed by budgetary
    constraints on the maintenance of adequate collections around
    the country, and the conflicting aims of supplying different

    resources in australia to respond to increasing and competing
    demands. discusses ways in which the dual aims of
    rationalisation through resource sharing and the protection of
    collection integrity might be achieved, taking into account the

    <text>the main tasks for czechoslovak libraries after the xvith
    communist party congress. public libraries, acting as an
    effective assistant of party organs and organisations, play an
    important role in gaining support for the communist party
    policies, its programme for world peace and the building of a
    developed socialist society. together with the czechoslovak
    system for scientific and technical information they are to
    play an even more prominent role in making available
    information for industry, agriculture and research. the system
    of information services in the sphere of culture and the arts
    within a particular region is being prepared by the setting up
    of regional information centres. bibliography will play a major
    role in this process of communication of information.
    statistics, library planning and the further development of
    theoretical librarianship and of library research are to become
    even more important components in the time to come.</text>

    <text>selection of bibliographical materials and acquisition
    policy' general problems. discusses the situation in latin

    to university libraries. examines the state of education in
    general, where higher education has been developed usually at
    the expense of the elementary stages; library development has
    benefited accordingly, but although some university libraries
    are adequately resourced, rationalisation and planning of
    future policies is essential to maximise use of resources.
    hence librarians should develop definite selection and

    <text>design of tree structures for efficient querying a
    standard information retrieval operation is to determine which
    records in a data collection satisfy a given query expressed in
    terms of data values. the process of locating the desired
    responses can be represented by a tree search model. this paper
    poses an optimization problem in the design of such trees to
    serve a well-specified application. the problem is academic in
    the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be
    implemented by means of practical techniques. on the other
    hand, it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords
    between observed performance and that of an intuitively
    attractive ideal search procedure. as a practical application
    of such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree
    search scheme based on a bit vector representation of data and
    shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design
    either an ideal search tree or a bit-vector tree. an
    experimental study of a small formatted file illustrates the
    concepts. september, 1973 casey, r. g. tree file, information

    <text>anomalous behavior of the fifty-percent rule in dynamic
    memory allocation this paper reports simulation data showing
    that, in dynamic memory allocation, the average
    free-to-allocated-block ratio can differ considerably and in
    both directions from the predictions of the 50 percent rule. a
    new derivation is given, and it is shown that previous
    derivations make an assumption that may be violated frequently.
    on the basis of the simulation data and the derivation, it is
    hypothesized that the anomalous behavior results from the
    combined effects of systematic placement and the statistics of
    the release process. additional simulations support this
    hypothesis. systematic placement, which refers to the natural
    convention of always allocating storage requests against the
    same end of the free block selected by the allocation strategy,
    tends to order blocks within contiguous groups according to
    their allocation time. the degree of anomalous behavior depends
    on the extent to which allocated blocks are released in the
    order of their allocation. for non-markovian release processes,
    the extent of the correlation between allocation order and
    release order varies approximately inversely with the
    coefficient of variation of the memory residence time
    distribution. the simulations show that allocation efficiency
    depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency
    decreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation
    increases. some practical implications are briefly discussed.

    may be the provision of technical facilities, provision of

    <text>the information explosion. a chapter from 2cybernetic

    and technical information, (sti), doubles every 10 years. at
    the vsesoyuznyi institut nauchnoi i tekhnicheskoi informatsii,
    (all-union sti institute), 1,000 workers make this literature
    accessible to soviet readers. this ocean of knowledge
    necessitates a national plan for information production and
    processing. ussr has a centralised state network of computer
    centres and a state sti system. the mezhdunarodnyi tsentr
    naucho-tekhnicheskoi informatsii, (international sti centre),
    serves socialist alliance countries. unisist is a world sti
    system. information science uses new resources to solve its
    technical problems. aids such as electronic pencils, sorters,
    universal information machines, lasers, should enable

    <text>a note on information organization and storage since the
    logical structure of a data base can be represented by a tree
    or graph, it is quite natural for us to view the process of
    designing a data base as that of constructing a tree or a
    graph. a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
    is provided. there are three important elements in this general
    construction method; namely, a set of binary relations, an
    algorithm for constructing subsets of a set, and an algorithm
    for selecting an element from the given set of objects. the use
    of different relations and algorithms results in different
    information structures, as list, tree, ring, etc. thus the
    problem of information organization and storage is reduced to
    that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a
    given set of constraints. the results presented may be valuable
    to designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as a
    basis for developing a formal theory on the subject. july, 1973

    <text>a computer analysis method for thermal diffusion in
    biochemical systems in the thermal detection of rapid
    biochemical reactions it is necessary to correct the
    temperature data for transient heat conduction losses in a
    cylindrical calorimeter. to handle the complexities arising
    from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating
    layers, a computer program was developed which gives the
    temperature distribution of the system as a function of radius
    and time. this distribution is corrected at each step by a
    subroutine which calculates the instantaneous chemical state of
    there action, as well as the heat produced by this reaction.
    the program is based on a direct statement of fourier's law of
    heat conduction and the chemical rate equation to provide a
    "bookkeeping law" to follow the reactants and the flow of heat
    packets, in such a way that the computer continually stores the
    heat distribution. a computer analysis method is here regarded
    as one in which the physical laws of a process are used
    explicitly in the program. usually this results in by passing
    much of the mathematical procedures conventionally used. the
    program was tested against some known exact solutions of the
    heat equation and gave identical results, and compared well
    with experimental data of a known biochemical reaction. the
    construction of computer programs based on the direct statement
    of the physical laws is a principle of general applicability
    which has been applied to several other physical phenomena.

    the kleene regular expression notation for describing algebraic
    language syntax, in particular of algol, is described in this
    paper. a fortran ii computer program for carrying out the
    elimination algorithm of gorn,similar to gaussian elimination
    for linear systems of algebraic equations, is described. this
    was applied to numerous smaller languages, including some
    sublanguage of algol. a hand calculation result of the
    application of the algorithm to all of algol is given, thus
    expressing the revised algol 1960 syntax in completely
    nonrecursive terms, as far as its context-free portion is
    concerned. this description in many ways is far more
    intuitively understood than the previous recursive description,
    it is suggested. the paper also includes results of the machine
    program, which does not include a simplification algorithm.

    germany for help with problems of insufficient qualified staff,
    outdated and inadequate stocks, shortage of equipment and the
    need to integrate the library into the school curriculum.
    seminars were arranged to provide opportunities for discussion
    and to help library staff to realise the school library's
    educational potential. a report was written for the deutsche
    gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarbeit (the german society

    taken up the offer of deposit of video cassettes from the state

    video is a material which properly belongs in a public library
    and can be acquired with public money. the desirability of
    having radio and tv programmes available for loan in public
    libraries has often been pointed out, but this would
    necessitate changes in the copyright act or direct negotiation
    by the libraries with the copyright holders. archives for radio
    and tv productions should be set up and the law on legal
    deposits expanded to include non-book material. cooperation
    within the nordic council is urged, and experiments in selected

    <text>on computing the fast fourier transform cooley and tukey
    have proposed a fast algorithm for computing complex fourier
    transform and have shown major time savings in using it to
    compute large transforms on a digital computer. with n a power
    of two, computing time for this algorithm is proportional to n
    log2 n, a major improvement over other methods with computing
    time proportional to n^2. in this paper, the fast fourier
    transform algorithm is briefly reviewed and fast difference
    equation methods for accurately computing the needed
    trigonometric function values are given. the problem of
    computing a large fourier transform on a system with virtual
    memory is considered, and a solution is proposed. this method
    has been used to compute complex fourier transforms of size n =
    2^16 on a computer with 2^15 words of core storage; this
    exceeds by a factor of eight the maximum radix two transform
    size with fixed allocation of this amount of core storage. the
    method has also been used to compute large mixed radix
    transforms. a scaling plan for computing the fast fourier
    transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given. october,

    <text>this is the way ruc has organised recording of tv.
    describes roskilde university library's videotape collection.
    some recordings were made from the start of the library in
    1971, but they were usually deleted. grants for modern
    video-cassette recorders in 1973 and the new copyright act of
    1977 making it legal to record radio and tv programmes for
    educational use enabled the library to organise recording and
    use in a system parallel to that for books. discusses the legal
    interpretation of who may record, what may be recorded,
    responsibility for possible compensation, free right to lend,
    duty to delete. argues that now that the legal question is
    cleared up, public and research libraries should organise a
    system for acquisition, registration, cataloguing and lending
    of recordings similar to that for books. describes roskilde's
    solution. orders for recording of danish and swedish tv
    programmes are received from staff and students and some
    recording is done on the library's own initiative. after
    recording, registration is done on the basis of the programme
    title. subject entries are made not according to udc, but to
    the library's own estimate of users' needs.</text>

    <text>transient-free working-set statistics transient-free
    average working set size and transient-free missing-page rate
    for a finite sample of a reference string are defined. use of
    these statistics is appropriate if the contents of the working
    set at the start of the recorded string are unknown. if a
    certain stationarity condition holds, these statistics provide
    unbiased estimates of expected working-set sizes, missing-page
    probabilities, and in terreference distance probabilities. two
    other pairs of estimators are shown to be biased. expressions
    for the transient-free statistics are obtained in terms of in
    terval statistics. several methods of computation are
    discussed, the usefulness of each depending on length of the
    sample, number of distinct references, and the amount of main
    storage available to the computer performing the calculations.
    in particular, methods are described for handling long strings

    reference string of arbitrary structure are considered, and an
    exact expression for average working set size in terms of
    "corrected" interreference interval statistics is derived. an
    example is discussed; upper and lower bounds are obtained; and
    the average working set size function is shown to be
    efficiently obtained for a set of page sizes, in a single pass
    of the reference string. this work follows the developments of
    a paper by denning and schwartz, who consider infinite-length
    reference strings which satisfy certain statistical properties
    and who derive an expression relating the asymptotic average
    working set size to the asymptotic missing page rate function

    <text>a heuristic approach to inductive inference in fact
    retrieval systems heuristic procedures are presented which have

    structure which is imposed on the data base using nonnumerical
    clustering algorithms. they are implemented in a model fact
    retrieval system which uses a formal query language and a
    property-list data structure. a program of experiments is
    described wherein the procedures are used with test data bases
    which are altered by deleting part of the data and by purposely
    introducing false data. it is found that the system can infer
    the correct response under a variety of conditions involving

    <text>an algorithm for finding a fundamental set of cycles of a

    of cycles for an undirected finite graph. a spanning tree is
    grown and the vertices examined in turn, unexamined vertices
    being stored in a pushdown list to await examination. one stage
    in the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown
    list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those edges (v,z) of the
    graph for which z has not yet been examined. if z is already in
    the tree, a fundamental cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z)
    is placed in the tree. there is exactly one such stage for each
    of the n vertices of the graph. for large n, the store required
    in creases as n^2 and the time as n^g where g depends on the
    type of graph involved. g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3,
    and it is shown that both bounds are attained. in terms of
    storage our algorithm is similar to that of gotlieb and corneil
    and superior to that of welch; in terms of speed it is similar
    to that of welch and superior to that of gotlieb and corneil.

    concept of bibliographic control, demonstrating its importance
    in librarianship. details are given of how the subject is
    integrated into the wider curriculum; the structure and
    organisation of the course; the actual content of the 8
    component units; and the teaching methods and materials used.
    finally reference is made to survey work conducted to monitor
    the effects of introducing the subject, and further evidence
    cited to support the conclusion that librarians are profiting
    from this initiative.</text>

    <text>synchronizing processors with memory-content-generated
    interrupts implementations of the "lock-unlock" method of
    synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually
    require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions. an
    interlock scheme called read-interlock, which does not require
    memory-pause instructions, has been developed for a dual dec
    pdp-10 system with real-time requirements. the read-interlock
    method does require a special"read-interlock" instruction in
    the repertoire of the processors and a special "read-interlock"
    cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules. when a processor
    examines a "lock" (a memory location) with a read-interlock
    instruction, it will be interrupted if the lock was already
    set; examining a lock immediately sets it if it was not already
    set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). writing
    into a lock clears it. having the processor interrupted upon
    encountering a set lock instead of branching is advantageous if
    the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt. june,

    the algorithms are presented and the relative performances of

    operating with the triangular array is the most sensitive to
    image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield a thinned

    <text>reference services as a teaching function. contribution
    to a thematic issue on library use instruction. reviews some of
    the arguments for and against the idea of a teaching function
    for reference librarians which have been put forward within the
    us library profession. describes the way in which the librarian
    fulfils his teaching role on a 1 to 1 basis at the reference
    desk, and by preparing various kinds of user guides. argues
    that in school and academic libraries the teaching function of
    the librarian must be intensified because of the educational
    objectives inherent in these environments. suggests that with
    decreasing library budgets in the 1980s, librarians, especially
    those in reference services, will be faced with justifying
    their functions and that a suitable way of doing this would be
    for the library to become a 'teaching library'.</text>

    8,000 pupils are catered for in 12 primary and secondary
    schools, 1 special school, 2 vocational schools and 2 colleges
    of further education. 123 classes visit the libraries weekly
    and special help is given to foreign children. aims for the
    future include increasing stocks in all libraries to 10 books
    per pupil, providing more space and stock for older pupils,
    incorporating teachers' libraries into the school libraries and

    even if it means including things he strongly disagrees with;
    librarians must be alert to the power of evil, but to conceal
    it is not to destroy it; the librarian spends public money,
    generated from people of many faiths, with different cultural
    and moral backgrounds; librarians need to be, and to be seen
    as, open persons who are consistently grappling with the issues
    of real life as they are reflected broadly in the publishing
    world; and finally, librarians should bea life-enhancing and a

    analysing favourite books, discovering the contents list,
    preface, title, publisher etc. and visits to libraries. during
    library visits the children worked in groups with given tasks.
    through asking librarians and others they were to discover

    <text>performance testing of a book and its index as an
    information retrieval system. the retrieval performance of book
    indexes can be measured in terms of their ability to direct a
    user selectively to text material whose identity but not
    location is known. the method requires human searchers to base
    their searching strategies on actual passages from the book
    rather than on test queries, natural or contrived. it
    circumvents the need for relevance judgment, but still yields
    performance indicators that correspond approximately to the
    recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval system

    <text>theft and destruction of library materials' the legal
    opportunities for dealing with theft from the collections and
    destruction of library materials. each year a considerable
    amount of material is written off by public libraries as a
    result of theft or damage by library users. in the maastricht
    public library in the netherlands a study of the problem made
    from jan-june 81 showed that some material was removed from the
    library without registering the transaction, some was borrowed
    on tickets containing false or incorrect information, while
    others were borrowed and not returned, or returned in a damaged
    condition. where proof of theft or destruction of library
    property exists the dutch civil code allows library authorities
    to instruct the local chief inspector of justice to take legal
    proceedings against the guilty party. where the defendant is
    found guilty the judge may order compensation to be made to the
    library concerned.</text>

    eliminate confusing and redundant constructs, and to make the
    language easy to compile. the resulting language is suitable
    for in troducing programming concepts used in various
    applications, including business data processing, scientific
    calculations and non-numeric computation. sp/k is actually a

    <text>an event-driven compiling technique due to the linear
    structure of source text, difficulties may arise in a one-pass
    compilation process. these difficulties occur when an entity
    cannot be processed because of a forward reference to
    information only obtainable from subsequent entities. classic
    solutions ask for data structures appropriate for each case. a
    technique is presented here which uses instead control
    structures, namely events and processes. the work of the
    compiler-writer becomes easier both conceptually and in
    practice because he can forget these problems at the outset and
    he avoids special processing for each problem. this technique
    has been applied to the construction of an algol 68 compiler.
    three examples from that implementation are described and
    discussed here. january, 1979 banatre, j.p. routeau, j.p.

    <text>experiments with the m &amp; n tree-searching program the
    m &amp; n procedure is an improvement to the mini-max
    backing-up procedure widely used in computer program for
    game-playing and other purposes. it is based on the principle
    that it is desirable to have many options when making decisions
    in the face of uncertainty. the mini-max procedure assigns to a
    max (min) node the value of the highest (lowest) valued
    successor to that node. the m &amp; n procedure assigns to a
    max (min) node some function of the m (n) highest (lowest)
    valued successors. an m &amp; n procedure was written in lisp
    to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that the m
    &amp; n procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max
    procedure. the statistical significance of important
    conclusions is given. since information on statistical
    significance has often been lacking in papers on computer
    experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these
    experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work.

    depository library suffers the consequences. often in the past,

    <text>the multistore parser for hierarchical syntactic
    structures a syntactic parser is described for hierarchical
    concatenation patterns that are presented to the analyzer in
    the form of linear strings. particular emphasis is given to the
    system of "significant addresses" by means of which processing
    times for large-scale matching procedures can be substantially
    reduced. the description makes frequent use of examples taken
    from the fully operational implementation of the parser in an
    experimental english sentence analyzer. by structuring an area
    of the computer's central core storage in such a way that the
    individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
    data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of
    information is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists
    is eliminated altogether. the matches are traced by means of
    binary masks and the state of single bits determines the
    operational flow of the procedure. the method could be
    implemented with any interpretive grammar, provided it can be
    expressed by the functional classification of the items
    composing the input hierarchical structures. february, 1970 von

    <text>an approach to the optimum design of computer graphics
    systems display system designers are faced with the difficult
    task of selecting major subsystems in an intelligent way. each
    subsystem is chosen from large numbers of alternatives; the
    selection is based on considerations such as system response
    time, system cost, and the distribution of data storage and
    processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
    data processing system. the work reported here develops an
    objective, quantitative design procedure and helps give a
    better understanding of now to configure display systems. this
    is accomplished by means of a mathematical model of a computer
    driven graphics system. the parameters of the model are
    functions of the capabilities of the graphics hardware and of
    the computational requirements of the graphics application. the
    model can be analyzed using numerical queueing analysis or
    simulation to obtain an average response time prediction. by
    combining the model with an optimization, the best graphics
    system configuration, subject to a cost constraint, is found
    for several applications. the optimum configurations are in
    turn used to find general display system design guidelines.

    <text>a unifying approach to scheduling this paper presents a
    scheme for classifying scheduling algorithms based on an
    abstract model of a scheduling system which formalizes the
    notion of priority. various classes of scheduling algorithms
    are defined and related to existing algorithms. a criterion for
    the implementation efficiency of an algorithm is developed and
    results in the definition of time-invariant algorithms, which
    include most of the commonly implemented ones. for
    time-invariant algorithms, the dependence of processing rates
    on priorities is derived. the abstract model provides a
    framework for implementing flexible schedulers in real
    operating systems. the policy-driven scheduler of bernstein and
    sharp is discussed as an example of such an implementation

    <text>bibliographic retrieval versus availability of documents'
    the problem of selection. librarians are constantly faced with
    the task of supplying literature on rapidly developing
    subjects, especially in technology and medicine. mechanical
    information retrieval is apt to yield vast amounts of
    references which have to be weeded out. criteria for this vary,
    but are usually dictated by necessity, namely the actual
    availability of documents. thus the user can readily be
    supplied with the relevant literature in well known journals
    stocked by the library. it is questionable whether the user
    gets a good coverage initially, or whether he must insist on
    total retrieval of documents. the problem of selection will
    probably become more acute in the future. a possible solution
    is to analyse the growth and spread of papers relevant to a
    specific topic in broader based journals.</text>

    <text>on generation of test problems for linear programming
    codes users of linear programming computer codes have realized
    the necessity of evaluating the capacity, effectiveness, and
    accuracy of the solutions provided by such codes. large scale
    linear programming codes at most installations are assumed to
    be generating correct solutions without ever having been
    "bench-marked" by test problems with known solutions. the
    reason for this failure to adequately test the codes is that
    rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily
    available. this paper presents a theoretical justification and
    an illustrative implementation of a method for generating
    linear programming test problems with known solutions. the
    method permits the generation of test problems that are of
    arbitrary size and have a wide range of numerical
    characteristics. october, 1974 charnes, a. raike, w. m. stutz,

    paper presented at the annual conference of the american

    have not been widely adopted, or been influential in library
    administration primarily because we do not yet have a good
    understanding of the context in which they should be
    interpreted. suggests that an understanding of the relevant
    aspects of the sociology of the community is essential to the
    design of library services, policies and goals, and to the
    meaningful interpretation of studies of collection use and user
    patterns. describes briefly an intelligence system for library

    who describes his career in librarianship and the establishment
    of the centre in 1975. the centre is supported financially by
    funded research only, but is helped also by its proximity to
    canada's largest research library at the university of toronto.
    for a research project in librarianship to be successful, the
    problem must be of current interest so that it can attract
    funds, it must be an area in which one specialises, and help
    must be sought from other experts. explains what a research
    problem is and how it is formulated in terms of the whole
    research process. discusses the research into the relationship
    between personality traits and effective library management,
    and argues that researchers should resolve problems which
    hinder decision-making, but they should not make the decisions
    themselves. research methods is a compulsory subject in the
    university's mls programme, stressing the importance of
    research if librarianship is to become a professional social

    <text>a process for the determination of addresses in variable
    length addressing an algorithm is presented for the assignment
    of instruction addresses and formats under the following
    conditions: (1) the length of the instruction varies as a
    function of the distance of the instruction from its target;
    (2) there exists an optimality criterion which implies some
    preferential choices subject to the addressing constraints.
    this may be, for example, achieving the smallest number of long
    instructions, in which case the total code length is minimized,
    or minimizing the assigned address of a specified point in the
    program. the algorithm is suitable for arbitrary program
    structure and a choice of optimization criteria. june, 1976

    <text>processing of patent bibliographic data at chemical

    1907. by the early 1970s, its manual data processing system for
    patents was showing signs of strain with a million records
    already and 200,000 being added annually. to convert to a
    computerised system would require 25,000 man-hours if existing
    records were to be contained in the new system. the solution to
    this problem was found in 1977. an agreement was negotiated
    with inpadoc (the international patent documentation centre)
    for inpadoc to deliver to cas a back-file of 1.2 million patent
    records in computer-readable form and weekly tapes of current
    patent bibliographic information. describes how cas selects

    standard list processing primitives are presented and
    thoroughly explained. particular attention is given to the
    problems of marking and relocating list cells while another
    processor may be operating on them. the primary aim throughout
    is to allow the list processor to run unimpeded while the other

    <text>automast: automatic mathematical analysis and symbolic

    ordinary differential equation is shown to also generate

    series expansion that includes an estimate of the error in the
    final result. a computer program is described that reads in a
    system of such equations and then generates the expansions for
    all of the dependent variables. the expansions are determined
    symbolically, hence any non-numeric parameters in the original
    equations are carried automatically into the final expansions.
    thus the exact influence of any parameters on the problem

    <text>reverse path forwarding of broadcast packets a broadcast
    packet is for delivery to all nodes of a network. algorithms

    packet switching computer network include (1) transmission of
    separately addressed packets. (2) multidestination addressing,
    (3) hot potato forwarding,(4) spanning tree forwarding, and (5)
    source based forwarding. to this list of algorithms we add (6)
    reverse path forwarding, a broadcast routing method which
    exploits routing procedures and data structures already
    available for packet switching. reverse path forwarding is a
    practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store-and-forward
    packet switching computer networks. the algorithm is described
    as being practical because it is not optimal according to
    metrics developed for its analysis in this paper, and also
    because it can be implemented in existing networks with less
    complexity than that required for the known alternatives.

    <text>it is useless to economise when money is in short supply.
    the german economy is adapting with difficulty to the
    recession, to the detriment of public budgets. culture is
    important during economic crises, therefore cultural bodies
    cannot renege on their social responsibilities. thrift may not
    always be the most economic procedure. an analysis is made of
    statistics on library expenditure by large and small local
    authorities in west germany in 1975-79 to illustrate the
    importance of the relationship between staffing costs and the
    total budget. a careful library policy must recognise the
    possibilities and limitations of adapting to the financial
    situation in the light of its social responsibilities. if
    rationalisation methods are carried out efficiently, the
    library service can adapt in the right way.</text>

    <text>intentional resolution of privacy protection in database
    systems traditionally, privacy protection in database systems
    is understood to be the control over what information a given
    user can get from a database. this paper is concerned with
    another, independent, dimension of privacy protection, the
    control over what a user is allowed to do with a piece of
    information supplied to him by the database. the ability to
    condition the supply of information on its intended use is
    called here "intentional resolution" of privacy protection. the
    practical importance of intentional resolution is demonstrated
    by several examples, and its realization is discussed. it is
    shown that intentional resolution can be achieved, but that it
    involves a radical change from the traditional approach to the
    process of user-database interaction. in particular, it appears
    to be necessary for the database to impose a certain amount of
    control over the internal behavior of users' programs which
    interact with it. a model for user-database interaction which
    admits such a control is developed. march, 1976 minsky, n.

    at the handicapped. library service to the handicapped places
    greater demands on the staff than other lending services. few
    users are able to help themselves to material and need
    assistance from the staff; most material needs to be examined
    and played before borrowing and checking on return. the
    department buys published editions of books cum tapes, and also
    records suitable books itself, but demand for material is far

    <text>poetry, coffee and cakes: poetry cafe ostergard.
    describes the efforts of halmstad public library to promote
    poetry. swedish public libraries acquire very little poetry,
    and poetry evenings are an exception. poetry cafe ostergard
    began in autumn 80 with evening gatherings held in halmstad's
    branch library in ostergard school. the aim was not to replace
    halmstad central library's author evenings, but to complement
    them with activities in a branch library. new forms were sought
    which involved the participants in active listening and
    conversation. a cafe atmosphere with coffee and cakes was
    created. many of the poets lived locally. the library prints
    posters and advertises in the local press and radio prior to
    each evening and prepares free folders with poems and
    introductions to the poets. emphasises that there must be
    continuity through regular activities and that more personal
    contact to promote the evenings and more participation by
    amateur poets are needed if the cafe is to cont inue.</text>

    <text>on coordination reduction and sentence analysis a class
    of coordination phenomena in natural languages is considered
    within the frame work of transformational theory. to account
    for these phenomena it is proposed that certain machinery be
    added to the syntactic component of a transformational grammar.
    this machinery includes certain rule schemata, the conditions
    under which they are to be applied, and conditions determining
    the sequence of subtrees on which they are to be performed. a
    solution to the syntactic analysis problem for this class of
    grammars is outlined. precise specification of both the
    generative procedure of this paper and its inverse is given in
    the form of lisp function definitions. april, 1969 petrick, s.

    coming year will include computerisation and maintenance of

    topics were' advantages of centralising the stocks of large
    libraries, or breaking them down into subject specialisations.
    discussion was based on a paper produced by the hungarian
    library institute; and scientific research and publications
    originating from individual libraries-this varies widely
    according to the facilities available, but some libraries
    produce a great deal of bibliographical research. a variety of
    visits during the conference gave the impression that hungarian
    libraries were much influenced by western developments and that
    libraries were heavily used.</text>

    <text>storage organization in programming systems the system of
    program and data representation that has been in use on the
    rice university computer for five years is described. each
    logical entity in storage occupies a block of consecutive
    memory locations. each block is labeled by a codeword and may
    contain a program, a data vector, or codewords which in turn
    label blocks to form arrays. this storage arrangement is
    discussed with its realized advantages or programming systems:
    simplicity of programmed addressing, flexibility of data
    structures, efficiency of memory utilization, variability of
    system composition during execution, means of linkage between
    programs and from programs to data, and basis for storage
    protection. the application of labeled blocks may be extended
    to areas of time-sharing and multimedia storage control. on the
    basis of experience at rice, some ideas on such extensions are
    presented. november, 1968 jodeit, j. g. storage allocation,

    similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed in time
    m x n, where m, n are the dimensions of the pattern frame.

    <text>the legal status of university libraries in the rhineland

    universities has made the position of university libraries more
    difficult than it was under the 1970 law with regard to their
    spheres of competence. current legislation is particularly
    vague about who should make decisions in library affairs, the
    rights of the various university bodies and their relationships
    with one another. detailed analysis is made of the 1978 law and
    its relevance to the library, the legal position of the
    library, its director and the senate and of individual legal
    problems such as the authority for stock purchase, control of
    staffing and finance, decisions on staffing made by the senate
    president, the library's tasks outside the university and legal
    disputes between the library and other university bodies. this
    analysis could prove helpful to university libraries in other
    states with similar laws.</text>

    <text>staffing in nigerian university libraries. describes a

    information requirements of scholarship and research, and
    whether the institutional settings in which staff work are
    conducive to effective professional service. among major
    elements examined were the librarians' perceptions of their
    responsibilities; their academic and professional backgrounds;
    work environments; job satisfaction and opportunities for
    continuing education and professional development. it was found
    that professional library service has been hindered by the
    inability of the library administrators to conceptualise the
    proper role of a librarian; rigid bureaucratisation in the
    libraries; failure to separate professional from
    non-professional duties; and by limited incentives and

    the evaluation, by the propagation of variance technique, of

    has led to separate programs for each system under

    required matrices from specific system equations supplied in
    subroutine form at execution time, eliminating the need for
    individualized programs, and presaging the further development

    <text>history of the kfar gil'adi library-a case study of
    kibbutz libraries (in hebrew). traces the development of kfar
    gil'adi's library, on the assumption that development was
    similar in other veteran kibbutzim. it is based mostly on oral
    and written documentation-a lengthy interview with haim
    yisraeli, founder of the library, minutes of kibbutz general
    meetings and written reports by librarians. when yisraeli
    arrived in kfar gil'adi in 1934 he found about 250 books.
    together with his wife he voluntarily organised the collection
    and enhanced it so that in 1938 it contained 10,000 volumes and
    became an important institution in the cultural life of the
    kibbutz members. today the library is no longer a cultural
    centre and the collection does not meet the needs of the
    members. discusses ways in which the library could once more
    become an important centre for the community.</text>

    <text>in service training courses for voluntary workers. in
    eastern slovakia from a total of more than 1,100 public
    libraries, about 950 are staffed by part-time librarians. they
    work on a voluntary basis mainly in the villages. on average
    50% are teachers from local schools. in spite of their
    dedication and hard work, the volunteers often lacked the
    necessary knowledge of librarianship and information science.
    for that reason, regulations, issued by the slovak ministry of
    culture in 1976, imposed the duty on district libraries to make
    provisions for in-service training of the said librarians,
    ranging from 8 to 24 hours per year. so far, the syllabuses of
    such short courses as well as teaching methods have varied
    considerably. in addition to the traditional lectures,
    discussions and role playing, for instance, are to be used more
    widely. more profound knowledge of both slovak and foreign
    literature (belles-lettres, fiction) and also a greater insight
    into the psychology of adults will no doubt, exercise
    favourable influence on the librarian's performance, which, in
    turn, will result in expansion of the local library and its
    services.</text>

    <text>library effectiveness in meeting information consumer's

    effectiveness in terms of meeting citizens' information needs.
    residents from 2,400 randomly-selected households in the new
    england states of the usa participated in 15-minute telephone
    interviews, july-oct 79. it appears that they infrequently
    consult libraries as an information resource in work or
    non-work situations. of the 17% using libraries, the majority
    (11%) do not have strong feelings about the library as an
    information provider. to become more effective competitors with
    other information providers, libraries must publicise resources
    and services more effectively, improve document delivery
    capability, and identify and reduce barriers encountered by the
    citizen when attempting to gain access to information.</text>

    collection and analysis techniques were applied to study volume
    of use, user activity, and availability of items sought by
    users in a public library. stratified sampling methods employed
    to measure volume of use and user activity showed that this
    medium-sized public library provided approximately 4,000 user
    service hours per week. the average visit lasted 34 minutes
    with 32% of all visit time spent reading library materials.
    overall availability of items sought by users in the adult

    <text>storage-efficient representation of decimal data usually
    n decimal digits are represented by 4n bits in computers.
    actually, two bcd digits can be compressed optimally and
    reversibly into 7 bits, and three digits into 10 bits, by a
    very simple algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of
    two variable field-length encodings. in over half of the cases
    the compressed code results from the conventional bcd code by
    simple removal of redundant 0 bits. a long decimal message can
    be subdivided into three-digit blocks, and separately
    compressed; the result differs from the asymptotic minimum
    length by only 0.34 percent. the hardware requirement is small,
    and the mappings can be done manually. january, 1975 chi chen,

    in these subjects take place at the end of the 4th and 6th
    semester. collection science provides knowledge concerning
    library collections, their organisation and maintenance. the
    main subject divisions are' history of collections; theory of
    collections; acquisition of collections; revision of
    collections; and care and maintenance of collections. the
    history of collections concentrates on german library history
    from the beginning of the 20th century then world war ii and
    the development of collection acquisition in east germany up to
    the present. the central subject of the course is collection
    acquisition. students study in depth the basic acquisition

    <text>retrieval-update speed tradeoffs using combined indices
    in a paper in the november 1970 communications of the acm, v.
    y. lum introduced a technique of file indexing named combined

    the cost of increased storage space. this paper examines
    combined indices under conditions of file usage with different
    fractions of retrieval and update. tradeoff curves are
    developed to show minimal cost of file usage by grouping

    the effects of the introduction of automation on information
    and documentation, and the possible consequences for future
    archives, when information stored on magnetic tape can very
    easily be rubbed out, accidentally or intentionally. the
    development of computer technology is traced from the time of
    pascal to the present, and the latest developments described in
    detail, with reference to government and industry requirements
    in canada. some explanations are given of machine readable
    catalogues and their operation, together with the terminology
    generated. examines the role of the archivist in construction
    of machine readable catalogues and their organisation in
    relation to classification, conservation and access. in
    conclusion, weighs the obvious advantages of automation against
    its potential hazards and problems for the archivist of the

    <text>requirements for advanced programming systems for list
    processing list processing systems should be designed to
    facilitate production of large programs to manipulate large
    complex symbolic data stores. this paper presents an overview
    of a number of system features which the author feels are
    important to improve the productivity of programmers working in
    such domains. a system view it taken, rather than focusing just
    on language features, since algorithms must be not only coded
    in a language form, but debugged, modified, made efficient, and
    run on data. because of this general framework,the requirements
    specified are applicable to the design of advanced programming
    systems for a wide range of applications. three aspects of
    programming systems are highlighted: good interactive
    facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
    data communication mechanisms. interactive features are
    described to facilitate program composition, entry, testing,
    debugging, editing, optimization, and packaging. implementation
    of a generalized environment structure model specified would
    allow programming of various control regimes including
    multiprocesses, coroutines and backtracking. alternative
    methods of procedure invocation required include invocation by
    pattern and by monitoring condition. the need for extended data
    forms, storage management, and extensibility are stressed, as
    is the duality of data retrieval and function evaluation.
    syntax directed input and output of data would facilitate use
    of complex data stores. july, 1972 bobrow, d. g. list

    <text>gedanken-a simple typeless language based on the
    principle of completeness and the reference concept gedanken is
    an experimental programming language with the following
    characteristics. (1) any value which is permitted in some
    context of the language is permissible in any other meaningful
    context. in particular, functions and labels are permissible
    results of functions and values of variables. (2) assignment
    and indirect addressing are formalized by introducing values,
    called reference, which in turn possess other values. the
    assignment operation always affects the relation between some
    reference and its value, (3) all compound data structures are
    treated as functions. (4) type declarations are not permitted.
    the functional approach to data structures and the use of
    references insure that any process which accepts some data
    structure will accept any logically equivalent structure,
    regardless of its internal representation. more generally, any
    data structure may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by
    giving an arbitrary algorithm for computing or accessing its
    components. the existence of label variables permits the
    construction of coroutines, quasi-parallel processes, and other
    unorthodox control mechanisms. a variety of programming
    examples illustrates the generality of the language.
    limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly. may,

    <text>experiments with some algorithms that find central
    solutions for pattern classification in two-class pattern
    recognition, it is a standard technique to have an algorithm
    finding hyperplanes which separates the two classes in a
    linearly separable training set. the traditional methods find a
    hyperplane which separates all points in the other, but such a
    hyperplane is not necessarily centered in the empty space
    between the two classes. since a central hyperplane does not
    favor one class or the other, it should have a lower error rate
    in classifying new points and is therefore better than a
    noncentral hyperplane. six algorithms for finding central

    <text>zero-base budgeting for libraries' a second look.
    zero-base budgeting (zbb) was given considerable attention in
    the management literature during the latter 1970s. zbb offers
    many concepts and budgeting techniques that may prove
    especially useful to library administrators in the budget-tight
    1980s. includes a brief review of the key features of zbb as a
    budgeting/planning system, a discussion of the applications of
    zbb reported in the literature, and a summary of the special
    benefits and problems for libraries that use of concepts
    derived from zbb, if not zbb itself, might provide.</text>

    science. from 1967-76, 4330 headings were listed. more than 90%
    were articles and special papers, and only the remaining 10%

    papers also paid attention to libraries. they emphasised,
    however, mostly general issues or topics of local interest and
    timing frequency as well as standards varied considerably.
    since 1954, 2bibliotekar1 has been almost the only stable
    periodical for librarians and has so far remained the only

    under the schools act. if they are to be transferred to the

    <text>characteristics of micros and their applications. in
    recent years, the market in microcomputers has mushroomed
    making such systems available at prices from under
    *6100-*610,000's, rivalling the facilities and power of
    minicomputers or even small mainframes. gives a brief history
    of the development of microcomputers and describes the various
    components of such a system. pays particular attention to the
    type of component that is likely to be available in systems
    which can be classified as 'small business systems' and
    investigates the applications of such systems. despite the vast
    market in microcomputers, there are still many restrictions
    which may prevent their being used in some applications, such
    as the capacity of the primary memory. furthermore, there are
    very few standards in the area of microcomputers, leading to
    problems of compatibility both from the hardware and software
    viewpoint. such problems are being overcome at present but it
    is likely that they will persist for some time to come as the
    pressures of marketing cannot wait for standards to be
    developed. the restrictions of microcomputers are also being
    overcome, particularly with the development of 16-bit (and even
    32-bit) processors and more sophisticated methods of storage,
    such as 'bubble memories'. examines such developments and
    briefly contrasts developments in hardware with those in
    software.</text>

    <text>development of a format for abstracting dose-response
    information from published studies for use in quantitative
    structure-activity relationships (qsars). the toxic substances
    control act subjects some 70,000 chemicals to regulatory
    action. however, empirical testing of the biological activities
    of this number of compounds is not feasible. an attractive
    alternative is the development of predictive methodology which
    can be used to estimate the potency of an untested compound
    toward a specific biological receptor. prerequisite to such an
    enterprise is the highly systematic compilation of
    dose-response information for a wide range of biological end
    points and for a wide variety of molecular species. a format is
    described for abstracting relevant information from published
    studies. the format outlines the test system, experimental
    conditions, response analysis, exposure protocol, and results
    and presents the original data, all in an organised form.
    regression analysis is used to estimate thres holds and
    potencies in the various test systems. the data may then be
    used to develop a predictive methodology.</text>

    compute the area contained by a closed boundary; generate the
    closed boundary representing the union or intersection of two

    space. since the collection occupies only from 25-45% of the
    floorspace in large academic libraries, these other factors
    must also be studied and remedied in order to limit building
    growth. the following measures to slow the increase in storage
    space are reviewed in detail' weeding; zero-growth; compact
    storage; coordinated acquisitions; miniaturisation. in
    connection with the arrangement of stored materials, detailed
    arguments are cited why browsing is an insufficient retrieval
    device for serious research. the point is made that a
    combination of the above measures is needed to reduce space
    pressures inherited from the past. furthermore, in
    acknowledgement of the studies showing that a high proportion
    of acquired works is rarely if ever used, a more limited and

    theory, each disk drive is characterized by a queueing model
    with service time of a disk drive represented by the
    probability density function of the sum of two uniform
    distributions. total response time of the set of disk models is
    then minimized under varying load conditions. the results
    indicate that faster devices should have higher utilization
    factors and that the number of different device types utilized
    tends to decrease with decreasing load. specific examples using
    2314 and 3330 combinations are examined. september, 1975

    <text>party-in-power as a determinant of state aid to public
    libraries. this study measures changes over nearly 30 years in
    the amount of aid provided by state governments to public
    libraries and the relationship of these changes to the party in
    power. aid is examined at 2 levels' the 1st views the party in
    power at the inception of state aid, the 2nd notes the party
    when a significant increase is made in aid levels. neither
    condition produces a definitive relationship to the party in
    power as defined by the study, and progress in aid seems nearly
    evenly divided between the ascendant parties, or at least in
    proportion to the dominant party across the usa at the time.

    currency of references; width of coverage; quality of indexing;
    and quantity of references. issues covering a 1 year period
    (1979) were examined and results for each periodical compared.
    additional characteristics were also compared' language of
    material indexed, countries of origin, type of material,
    inclusion of indexes, and price. the final conclusion drawn was
    that the 2 periodicals are largely similar apart from
    variations in index provision, classification procedure, and

    <text>an examination of book buyers and library users. very few
    people either only buy their books or only obtain them from a
    library and many people buy books as often as they borrow them.
    library users who borrow few books buy a larger proportion of
    their books than library users who borrow many books. however,
    whereas over 1/2 the population of germany buy books, only
    about 1/4 use public libraries. investigations have revealed
    that important influences on behaviour regarding the use of
    books include the home background, school and general social
    environment. an individual's sense of values also plays its
    part, often influenced by the media and communication
    possibilities. perhaps the main influence is the social
    learning process and an individual's own attitude towards it.
    there are still numerous unexplored possibilities for
    influencing children and adults in their use of books.</text>

    satisfactory. the problems still existing are connected to the
    university laws concerning the library which do not guarantee
    the competence of the library director in library matters. this
    has led to interference in library affairs by other university

    <text>standardisation of information work as a means for
    improvement of the organisation and methodology of scientific
    and technical information departments. 1 of the trends of the
    future development of the ussr state system of scientific and
    technical information is standardisation of information work
    and library tasks. approximately 50 standards are planned to be
    published within the 11th 5-year plan. standards are being
    prepared by a number of information departments attached to
    academic institutions and manufacturing companies, thus the
    preparation of standards is not always sufficiently
    coordinated. an analysis of the standardisation of various
    aspects of information work was therefore carried out. its
    results show that it is essential to prepare an unified plan of
    standardisation covering all aspects of information work.
    methodological recommendations must be prepared in cooperation
    with official bodies of the state system of scientific and
    technical information and particular attention sh ould be paid

    <text>stability of oscillation in valve generators a

    applicable to a large class of harmonic oscillators the paper
    is concerned mainly with the terminal regenerative type of
    oscillator with grid leak bias but the analysis applies also to
    circuits with fixed grid bias and to terminal oscillators all
    known forms of instability appear as special cases of the
    general theory and some new forms are predicted stability is
    determined by the nature of the roots of a characteristic
    equation and stability criteria are obtained in the form of
    inequalities between the parameters of the amplifier and
    feedback network a modified form of nyquist locus diagram can
    also be used when the feedback network is symmetrical with
    respect to the oscillation frequency the characteristic
    equation can be factorized to give independent criteria for
    frequency and amplitude stability hysteresis effects and
    periodic instability are analysed in detail in addition to the
    general treatment specific forms of the various parameters
    which appear in the stability criteria are worked out for a

    <text>a comparison of the correlational behavior of random
    number generators for the ibm 360 hutchinson states that the
    "new" (prime modulo) multiplicative congruential pseudorandom
    generator, attributed to d. h. lehmer, has passed the usual
    statistical tests for random number generators. it is here
    empirically shown that generators of this type can produce
    sequences whose autocorrelation functions up to lag 50 exhibit
    evidence of nonrandomness for many multiplicative constants. an
    alternative generator proposed by tausworthe, which uses
    irreducible polynomials over the field of characteristic two,
    is shown to be free from this defect. the applicability of
    these two generators to the ibm 360 is then discussed. since
    computer word size can affect a generator's statistical
    behavior the older mixed and simple congruential generators,
    although extensively tested on computers having 36 or more bits
    per word, may not be optimum generators for the ibm 360.

    <text>a modular computer sharing system an alternative approach
    to the design and organization of a general purpose interactive
    multiterminal computing system is presented. the system
    organization described is a conceptually simple arrangement of
    a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which is a
    memory/processor pair, that are assigned to process terminal
    jobs as they arrive. one of the computers serves as the master
    or control computer and supervises the collection and
    distribution of messages from and to the remote terminals. in
    the simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
    terminal. a crosspoint switching network allows any such disk
    drive to be connected to any computer. thus, while each active
    terminal user "occupies" a dedicated disk drive, he may share
    the computer with many other terminal users in a simple manner.
    the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both the size
    and power of the machines used and the computation requirements
    of the particular mix of users. this system organization is
    inherently a simpler and therefore more reliable approach to
    time-sharing computers and has the potential of a highly
    available system at relatively low cost. economic
    configurations are possible for a range of systems sizes that
    span at least one order of magnitude. finally, problem programs
    developed by remote terminal users can be run on a dedicated
    batch system if compatible computers are used. october, 1969

    <text>a stochastic evaluation model for database organization
    in data retrieval systems experimental work in the valuation of

    difficulty and prohibitive cost. this paper discusses a
    simulation model of a data retrieval system which has the
    effect of significantly reducing the cost of experimentation
    and enabling research never attempted before. the model is
    designed to estimate the retrieval workload of alternative data
    retrieval systems. these data retrieval systems can be
    organized under several database organizations, including
    inverted list, threaded list, and cellular list organizations
    and hybrid combinations of these systems. effectiveness of the
    methodology is demonstrated by using the model to study the
    effect of database organizations in data retrieval systems. in
    particular, the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

    <text>the duality of classification' taxonomy and meronomy.
    contribution to a section on current trends in classification
    research. in the context of natural classification systems
    development, classification is viewed as the grouping of
    objects in classes (taxons) and as the finding of common
    structures (archetypes) within the objects. an archetype is a
    structure of parts (merons). the classification procedure can
    be represented as an interactive process whereby the grouping
    by taxons alternates with the identification of taxon
    archetypes, which are used again to update the taxon
    composition. presents a mathematical description of the
    relationship between the taxonomic grouping of objects and
    their partitioning into merons, with special mention of the
    methodological problems of classification.</text>

    that a study by an 18th century scholar, thomas bennet, ranks
    well with current bibliographical studies. the work, on the
    thirty-nine articles of religion, was published in 1715, and
    consisted of 18 copies of the articles, 5 in latin and 13 in
    english. bennet reproduced exactly the text of one master copy
    in each language, and then recorded, in footnotes on the same
    page, every variation to be found in every other copy. details
    of evidence were then analysed, and conclusions drawn. a brief
    biography of bennet, and further details of his work are
    given.</text>

    <text>a study of inter-library lending at the suhl district
    research library. in the last 3-4 years 5,000 book orders were
    processed annually by the suhl district research library. these
    include all the orders which were placed at other libraries in
    the district. between 40%-50% of ordered books can now be
    provided from the library stock at the research library. the
    book stock has grown from 25,000 in 1961 to 205,000 in 1979. in
    1966 a weekly courier service was introduced to improve
    inter-library lending. the suhl courier service operates
    between the central library of german classics, weimar, the
    university library, jena and back to the research library. on
    average 50% of books ordered could be supplied in under 10 days
    using the courier service.</text>

    <text>addressing multidimensional arrays a useful method of
    representing a function of n variables is to consider the
    function to assume its values at selected points in
    n-dimensional space. although this picture is of value to the
    analyst, the elements of an n-dimensional array must exist in
    conventional storage as a linear array or vector. the means of
    performing the transformation of a set of indices locating on
    array element in n-space to the location (address) of the
    element in its storage vector is the subject of this paper. it
    is noted that the index address transformation is
    computationally identical to the conversion of a number from a
    fixed to a mixed radix number system. several ways of
    implementing the transformation are described. april, 1962

    less apparent problem of providing efficiency and flexibility
    as scheduled events are accessed to be executed. additional
    features and problems dealt with include the proper handling of
    simultaneous events; that certain events must be created,
    scheduled, and executed at the same points in simulated time;
    that infinite loops caused by the concatenation of such
    "zero-time" events are possible and must be diagnosed; that
    maintaining various event counts is practical and economical;
    and that a capability for handling "time-displaceable" events
    is desirable and possible. september, 1978 ulrich, e.g.

    <text>the videogram report-published too late?. the videogram
    commission's report suggests that libraries should be
    distribution centres for a broad supply of good quality video
    recordings, but video has already become a mass market article
    supplied through international distribution channels and
    libraries have little chance of making an impact. a working
    group of representatives of cultural institutions, the
    vidmo-group, was formed already in 1973; it hoped to start
    experiments in libraries with production and showing of
    videograms, but trade union opposition meant that the swedish
    broadcasting corporation's programmes could not be used. other
    reports have appeared pointing to the advantages of libraries
    as distributors of video, but without state financial support
    public libraries will never be able to fulfil this role. some
    areas are, however, open to libraries, provided they cooperate
    with each other and other organisations' videograms for the
    deaf and other handicapped; videograms produced directly for
    the medium by artists and media workshops; videograms for
    children; for education in cooperation with the educational

    <text>lessing's library post in wolfenbuttel. part i. gotthold
    ephraim lessing was librarian at the court of brunswick and
    luneberg in the 1770s. some of his most important writings were
    produced during this period but it should not be thought that
    the post was a sinecure held to enable him to write. there is
    proof in his own works that he took librarianship seriously.
    the opinions of various contemporary and modern writers on
    lessing's library work are analysed. many of his contemporaries
    thought him disorganised but his catalogue of new library
    stocks, amounting to about 100,000 volumes, remained unfinished
    because of staff shortages and ultimately because of his own
    death. some people regard him as the theoretical founder of

    of iowa/iowa state university network, the michigan educational
    research information triad, inc., and the triangle universities
    computation center network in north carolina. in-depth studies

    <text>teletext and viewdata' a new challenge for the designer.
    teletext and viewdata displays present a strong challenge to
    the information designer. the monospaced dot matrix characters
    are relatively crude in their design, and their positioning is
    determined by a fixed grid. the graphics facility is also
    somewhat crude. the scope for typographic and spatial coding of
    information is therefore very limited. there is, however, the
    possibility of using colour as a way of coding information. 7
    colours, including white, are available, but they are not of
    equal brightness and this has important implications for
    legibility. bearing in mind the constraints and freedom offered
    by this kind of display, ways of presenting text, tables,

    <text>library censorship and the permissive minority.
    re-analyses a nation-wide survey of us adults conducted in 1970
    for the commission on obscenity and pornography to permit new
    comparisons of the large majority who favoured library
    censorship of 'erotica' with the minority who opposed it. as
    expected from previous studies, there were significant
    differences between the 2 groups-for example, those opposing
    censorship were younger, better educated, more open to mass
    media, and by a number of measures, more liberal or permissive.
    the anticensorship position appears to be part of a general
    liberal ideology that extends to such issues as racial
    integration and evnironmentalism. further, the anticensorship
    group has much in common with the group identified by other
    studies as users of public libraries.</text>

    <text>a card format for reference files in information
    processing this paper proposes a card format suitable for a
    variety of reference files in information processing. an
    80-column ibm card is divided into two fields-reference
    material field (columns 1-67) and identification field (columns
    68-80). the format for the reference material is flexible,
    while the format for the identification is rigid. the reference
    material includes basically an index, title, source, class,
    summary and cross reference for each entry. the identification
    includes basically codes for a matrix of descriptors, an entry
    number, and the kind, major interest, and source of the
    reference. the identification also provides a choice to
    identify material for personal as well as general files. since
    this card format is sufficient to identify the material
    normally associated with reference files for books, articles,
    programming terms, hardware terms, equipment, machine systems,
    abbreviations, etc., it is suitable as a standard for card
    reference files in information processing. february, 1961

    will probably be used most in specialised education rather than
    the more general field. future enhancements should include
    microprocessor-controlled terminals connected in clusters over
    a single telephone line, improved graphics facilities, and the
    linking of small in-house systems to the national prestel
    network as more educational institutions acquire their own
    computers.</text>

    buildings as well as the computerisation of library and
    information services have been studied by the staff of a
    special department at the cyril and methodius national library
    in sofia. now, the time has come to establish an independent
    technical centre for libraries, similar to the one in prague,
    czechoslovakia. among the centre's 1st and foremost commitments
    should be the collection of information on the contemporary
    worldwide trends in the development of library buildings and
    their up-to-date equipment. this broad general knowledge should
    be pooled for the new, specified library buildings, and also
    for the reconstruction, extension and modernisation of existing
    libraries. such activities should lead to the establishment of
    archives of technical documentation and industrial catalogues
    for the benefit of architects, designers, librarians and
    others. other long-term targets include the design of a new,
    progressive method of service to readers and information users

    were complemented by visits to the czech state library and to
    the patents library. the purpose of the conference was not only
    to discuss the latest information but also to outline prospects
    for the future, and to encourage closer cooperation between the
    comecon countries. it was also pointed out that expansion of
    libraries must not be hampered by the inevitable economic

    <text>library stock as a system of partial bookstocks. in a
    particular library the bookstock is a heterogenous entity which
    consists of materials in different subjects and languages, with
    different chronological and regional connotations which serve a
    broad spectrum of readers. thus, the available bookstock
    naturally subdivides into a number of entities which belong to
    the same category and the subject matter appears to be the most
    important criterion. large libraries in slovakia e.g.
    university libraries have specific reading rooms for partial
    bookstock e.g. natural sciences or librarianship. special
    partial bookstock may consist of internal publications such as
    theses, research reports, internal translations and others. in
    dealing with partial bookstock it is important to establish the
    type of reader using it (e.g. children), the physical form of
    the stock (traditional or micro), geographical relevance and
    the frequency of its usage. the differential aspect of
    bookstock is well worth bearing i n mind for the most effective
    way of utilising library resources.</text>

    libraries/media centres as indispensible prerequisites for the
    realisation of educational aims have been discussed since the
    1970s, but librarians' high expectations have generally not
    been realised. even in comprehensive schools, media centres are
    still only on the fringe of school life. the use of a media
    centre as a focal point of school activities demands radical
    changes in school structure and the teacher's role. many of the
    media provided are unsuited to the school learning situation.
    teachers have to spend much time planning the development of
    independent study programmes; close cooperation with school
    librarians would prove helpful here. administration of
    centrally stored media is effective and economical but since
    much time is wasted when children move between classroom and
    media centre, flexible timetables should be developed.</text>

    external memory fragmentation. algorithms main taining separate
    free space lists for each size of memory block used tended to
    perform quite well compared with other algorithms. simple
    algorithms operating on memory ordered lists (without any free
    list) performed surprisingly well. algorithms employing
    power-of-two block sizes had favorable processing requirements
    but generally unfavorable memory usage. algorithms employing

    <text>the organisational and functional structure of an unified
    collection of literature on natural sciences and technology.
    presents the results of an analysis of the organisation and of
    the structure of the unified information stock (literature on
    natural sciences and technology) of the armenian soviet
    socialist republic. the analysis concentrates on 3 main areas:
    administrative organisation of the stock; subject coverage; and
    territorial distribution. chemical literature represents the
    largest proportion of the stock. most of the information stock
    is located in the erevan region (88.4%), while only 0.3% of the
    stock is located in the kafan region, due to the different
    level of industrial development of the regions.</text>

    <text>vital needs of libraries. for years now libraries and
    librarians in bulgaria have been following the example of their
    soviet counterparts in the organisation of library and
    information services. targets for bulgaria's economic growth,
    technological advancement and the population's higher living
    standard in the 1980s make the significance of soviet
    literature and periodicals still more obvious. concentrating
    upon concrete tasks and problems in their area, librarians must
    supply their readers and others working in local industries,
    research institutes, schools and colleges with relevant
    information. soviet sources, such as technical periodicals have
    been most useful in the past and will continue to be in the
    future. librarians can rely upon assistance given by the staff
    at the house of soviet science and culture in sofia.
    partnerships with soviet libraries have also proven valuable.
    some ventures from the pleven region (northern bulgaria) are
    given as examples of successful promotion of sovi et literature
    and experience in librarianship among the bulgarian
    public.</text>

    <text>on the near-optimality of the shortest-latency-time-first
    drum scheduling discipline for computer systems in which it is
    practical to determine the instantaneous drum position, a
    popular discipline for determining the sequence in which the
    records are to be accessed is the so-called
    shortest-latency-time-first, sltf, discipline. when a
    collection of varying-length records is to be accessed from
    specified drum positions, it is known that the sltf discipline
    does not necessarily minimize the drum latency time. however,
    we show that the total time to access the entire collection for
    any sltf schedule is never as much as a drum revolution longer
    than a minimum latency schedule. june, 1973 stone, h. s.

    association, mar 81, and held in ishoj, which has denmark's
    largest concentration of immigrants with 50 different languages
    spoken by a population of 21,000. the mayor of ishoj argued
    that immigrants must assimilate and learn danish, whereas the 3
    immigrant spokesman claimed that children must learn their
    mother tongue properly before they can learn danish, if they
    are not to be culturally isolated, knowing 2 languages only
    partly. book provision was 6 books per dane, but only 1/2 per
    immigrant. the librarians present pointed out the enormity of
    the problem of library provision to immigrants speaking so many
    different languages, and asked for more bilingual librarians
    and closer contact with schools on matters of linguistic
    background and book selection.</text>

    <text>semantic evaluation from left to right this paper
    describes attribute grammars and their use for the definition
    of programming languages and compilers; a formal definition of
    attribute grammars and a discussion of some of its important
    aspects are included. the paper concentrates on the evaluation
    of semantic attributes in a few passes from left to right over
    the derivation tree of a program. a condition for an attribute
    grammar is given which assures that the semantics of any
    program can be evaluated in a single pass over the derivation
    tree, and an algorithm is discussed which decides how many
    passes from left to right are in general necessary, given the
    attribute grammar. these notions are explained in terms of an
    example grammar which describes the scope rules of algol 60.
    practical questions, such as the relative efficiency of
    different evaluation schemes, and the ease of adapting the
    attribute grammar of a given programming language to the
    left-to-right evaluation scheme are discussed. february, 1976

    <text>sitar: an interactive text processing system for small

    comparable to in teractive bibliographical search and retrieval
    systems, but has several additional features. it is implemented
    on a pdp/11 time-sharing computer invoked by a crt with
    microprogrammed editing functions. it uses a simple command
    language designating a function, a file, and a search template
    consisting of the textual string desired and strings delimiting
    the context in which the hit is to be delivered. extensive
    experience with sitar shows that the combined powers of simple
    commands, string orientation, circular file structure, a crt
    with local memory, and conversational computing produce a
    system much more powerful than the sum of its parts. july, 1977

    <text>interlibrary lending' a south-east asian perspective.
    edited version of a paper given to the ifla section on
    interlending at the ifla general conference, manila, the
    philippines, aug 80. surveys interlending in the countries
    which comprise the consortium of national libraries and
    documentation centres, south-east asia-indonesia, malaysia, the
    philippines, singapore and thailand. a questionnaire survey
    revealed that the volume of interlending varied greatly between
    these countries and was generally low. many more interlibrary
    loan requests were sent abroad than were received. only a few
    libraries had telephone and telex links, but many had
    reprographic equipment. requests were sent mainly to subject
    specialist libraries, and union catalogues and central
    collections were less used. charges were minimal. stresses the
    importance of maintaining national and international
    statistics. this is 1 function of national interlending
    centres, which should be established as independent units in

    <text>n-dimensional codes for detecting and correcting multiple
    errors the paper introduces a new family of codes for detecting
    and correcting multiple errors in a binary-coded message. the
    message itself is arranged (conceptually) into a
    multidimensional rectangular array. the processes of encoding
    and error detection are based upon parity evaluations along
    prescribed dimensions of the array. effectiveness of the codes
    is increased by introducing a "system check bit", which is
    essentially a parity check on the other parity bits. only
    three-dimensional codes are discussed in this paper with parity
    evaluations along the horizontal, the vertical, and one main
    diagonal. however, the family of codes is not restricted to
    three dimensions, as evidenced by the discussion by minnick and
    ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bit selection
    plan used for another purpose [6]. a four-dimensional code,
    correcting three and detecting four errors, has been developed;
    the extension to higher-dimensional codes with greater
    correction power is straightforward. december, 1961 rubinoff,

    to predicted probability of activity. the results showed 34% of
    the active compounds in the top 10% of the ranking. in a second
    study the predictive ability of a chemist and the computer were
    compared by having each rate almost 1,000 previously unselected

    <text>a stochastic approach to the grammatical coding of
    english a computer program is described which will assign each
    word in an english text to its form class or part of speech.
    the program operates at relatively high speed in only a limited
    storage space. about half of the word-events in a corpus are
    identified through the use of a small dictionary of function
    words and frequently occurring lexical words. some suffix tests
    and logical-decision rules are employed to code additional
    words. finally, the remaining words are assigned to one class
    or another on the basis of the most probable form classes to
    occur within the already identified contexts. the conditional
    probabilities used as a basis for this coding were empirically
    derived from a separate hand-coded corpus.on preliminary
    trials, the accuracy of the coder was 91% to 93%, with obvious
    ways of improving the algorithm being suggested by an analysis
    of the results. june, 1965 stolz, w. s. tannenbaum, h.

    retrospective book bibliographies range from the 1st books
    printed before 1500, to 1965. foreign books on slovakia and the
    slovaks are also listed. other bibliographies include slovak
    sheet music and gramophone records as well as theoretical
    writings on music and its history. there are bibliographies of
    special publications, for example exhibition catalogues and
    books for the blind, and also of daily papers and periodicals,
    published in slovakia not only in slovak, but also in other
    languages. calendars (1700-1965), slovak professional, amateur
    and marionette theatre and radio and film (1918-1945) are among
    other subjects of national bibliographies. the current
    computerised slovak national bibliographies comprise sections a
    to j, covering books, periodicals, maps, theses and
    dissertations, special publications, trade catalogues,
    technical newsletters, fine arts, sheet music, official

    immediately in a pharmacy, at a sick-bed, in a research
    institute or a pharmaceutical factory. those involved in
    training need specialist books and journals. in hungary, these
    can be purchased by everybody, although purchase of foreign
    materials may be financially difficult. library budgets should
    permit the purchase of expensive bibliographies and abstracting
    journals, and reference books, librarians insisting on their
    continuous acquisition. financial problems may be solved by
    budgets which follow proportional price increase, and by
    governments willing to reduce import profit rates of materials
    for education, research and medical treatment. librarians
    should be well acquainted with the terminology, training system
    and literature of their field, and be qualified to introduce

    <text>internal and tape sorting using the replacement-selection
    technique a general technique for sequencing unsorted records
    is presented. the technique is shown to be applicable for the
    first stage of a generalized sort program (the formation of
    initial strings) as well as for sorting records within a memory
    storage (an internal sort). it is shown that given n records in
    memory storage, records are sequenced using 1+log2 n tests per
    record, that initial string lengths will average 2n for random
    input records, and that reading, writing and processing can be
    accomplished simultaneously if the computer permits such
    overlap. may, 1963 goetz, m. a. ca630502 jb march 14, 1978

    <text>a model and stack implementation of multiple environments
    many control and access environment structures require that
    storage for a procedure activation exist at times when control
    is not nested within the procedure activated. this is
    straightforward to implement by dynamic storage allocation with
    linked blocks for each activation, but rather expensive in both
    time and space. this paper presents an implementation technique
    using a single stack to hold procedure activation storage which
    allows retention of that storage for durations not necessarily
    tied to control flow. the technique has the property that, in
    the simple case,it runs identically to the usual automatic
    stack allocation and deallocation procedure. applications of
    this technique to multitasking, coroutines, backtracking,
    label-valued variables, and functional arguments are discussed.
    in the initial model, a single real processor is assumed, and
    the implementation assumes multiple-processes coordinate by
    passing control explicitly to one another. a multiprocessor
    implementation requires only a few changes to the basic
    technique, as described. october, 1973 bobrow, d. g. wegbreit,

    <text>answering the challenge of teletext, viewdata systems and

    newspapers are facing challenges from the new media of
    teletext, viewdata systems, and home computers. teletext
    provides news immediately, simply, conveniently, and
    inexpensively. however, it does not provide the browse and scan
    options of newspapers. of greater potential impact is the
    development of viewdata systems which use the television,
    telephone, and computer so that on-line searching can be done
    from the home. the system can also be modified to use a home
    computer rather than a television screen. changes in how people
    spend their leisure time and their disposable income, combined
    with the stagnation of newspaper readership and the

    <text>multi-attribute retrieval with combined indexes in this
    paper a file organization scheme designed to replace the use of
    the popular secondary index filing scheme (or inverted files on
    secondary key fields) is described. through the use of
    redundancy and storing keys (or access numbers of the records)
    that satisfy different combinations of secondary index values
    in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve all keys satisfying
    any input query derived from a subset of fields by a single
    access to an index file, although each bucket may be used for
    many combinations of values and a combination of buckets may be
    required for a given query. the method which, in its degenerate
    case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing scheme
    works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the
    elimination of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the
    elimination of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer
    time to perform intersection of key sets each qualified for one
    secondary index field only; and (4) the avoidance of long
    strings of keys when an index field appearing in a query has
    very few possible values. redundancy, in some cases, is the
    same as the secondary indexing method. in the general case,
    trade-off between the number of accesses for query and
    redundancy exists. november, 1970 lum, v. y. file organization,

    between popular, high and mass culture. the public library
    supports popular culture in trying to meet the needs of people
    at all levels, regardless of background, education and economic

    all levels, but wherever possible, with the best in each of
    these levels; thus the librarian must still be selective, and

    and points out that on-line information retrieval is 5 to 10
    times faster than manual retrieval. lists the disadvantages of
    on-line information systems: the building of data bases is a
    complex task; duplication of information is unavoidable; the
    costs are high and staff must be trained to use these systems.
    in addition, staff must learn a number of 'command languages'
    because of the large number of on-line systems available. this
    problem could perhaps be overcome by using 'transparent
    systems' which function as an interface, or 'a translator',
    between the searcher and the machine. in this case the searcher
    would only need one command language.</text>

    by no means a library scientist. thus library skills should be
    attained by practice. the author feels that the transmission of
    information in a library is a complex operation, requiring
    training at a higher education level. this training,
    incorporating up-to-date knowledge, is the essence of the

    objects, contact with the artists, publicity, an opening at
    which the artists were present, guides to the exhibition,
    workshops, talks and public discussions. all the library had to
    do was provide the exhibition rooms. the exhibition was
    extremely successful and acted as a stimulus to other groups

    was an issue control system and was followed by automation of
    most technical routines. under development is the library user
    information service, (luis), a system which allows on-line
    searching in the library's catalogue of acquisitions since
    1970. the card catalogue is, however, being maintained meantime
    as luis does not allow subject searches, nor has full
    bibliographic details. although cost effectiveness of
    automation prior to its introduction had not been considered
    the system has been smoothly installed and had led to increased
    productivity in the technical department. there was general
    satisfaction with the fact that the library had been ab le to

    <text>optimum merging from mass storage an algorithm is
    displayed which yields the merge orders such that the total
    read time, defined to be the sum of seek time plus
    data-transfer time, is minimized for a sort using mass storage.
    the analysis is parameterized in terms of the ratio of seek
    time to the time it takes to fill available core with records,
    and the file size in units of core lengths; and thus it can be
    applied to any conventional cpu/mass storage combination. an
    explicit formula for total read time is derived, in terms of
    the parameters, which correlates very well with the total read
    time calculated using the optimum merge orders yielded by the
    algorithm. the formula involves the roots of a simple
    transcendental equation. a short table of these roots is
    included. numerical results are graphically displayed for a

    <text>feeling the draft: quality in our ethical debate. report
    on the draft code of professional ethics produced by the
    library association working party on ethics. librarians and
    information workers in the uk are latecomers to the question of
    professional ethics. a us code was developed in 1938, and other
    professions have had codes since the 19th century. the
    overriding reason for such a code is the protection of the
    client, but it also offers protection for the professionals
    themselves, and could enhance the status of the profession. at
    the very heart of the la code is responsive and responsible

    and loans demand more rationalisation. the limba project is
    concerned with the production by electronic data processing of
    guard catalogues for public libraries, the book form being
    considered more compact and portable than card files. each
    volume is planned in 3 sections, namely' science and other
    non-fiction; fiction; and children's literature. the contents,
    corresponding with library stocks in large branch libraries,
    will be kept up to date by the publication of cumulative
    supplements every 6 months. new complete editions are planned
    every 2 years. the book catalogues are intended to replace card
    catalogues in branches, small municipal and rural libraries and
    in trade union libraries. limba's data bank file dalis is the
    1st stage of a complete electronic data processing system

    <text>cpi surveys-a service to subscribers. the canadian

    periodical indexes were produced. today it is organised by the
    canadian library association, which assumed responsibility for
    it in 1946. every 3 years cla establishes new rates by means of
    a subscription rate survey. a questionnaire is sent to all
    subscribers, listing periodicals covered by cpi, and asking
    subscribers to list which of these are included in the
    institution's holdings. cost-per-entry is then established, and
    total entries for a year in cpi are calculated. taking costs of
    salaries, automation, publishing and rent, cpi's budget is
    established. discusses the survey in detail and other

    lecture given at the ifla/unesco seminar in leipzig, aug 81. in
    the gambia library work with children is given priority over
    that with adults to encourage the spread of literacy. the
    service must provide material to help with formal schooling,
    encourage creative and emotional development and assist
    children in finding information. children's departments in
    public libraries cater for the 11-19 year olds; an attractive
    appearance is maintained and extra activities like story hours
    and film shows are provided. the national library has central
    control over children's libraries, providing school library
    stocks and advice and training for staff. assistance is also
    provided by the british council. more books are required; there
    are few modern publishing services in the gambia. more money is
    needed, especially for primary school libraries and more

    <text>scheduling independent tasks to reduce mean finishing
    time sequencing to minimize mean finishing time (or mean time
    in system) is not only desirable to the user, but it also tends
    to minimize at each point in time the storage required to hold
    incomplete tasks. in this paper a deterministic model of
    independent tasks is introduced and new results are derived
    which extend and generalize the algorithms known for minimizing
    mean finishing time. in addition to presenting and analyzing
    new algorithms it is shown that the most general
    mean-finishing-time problem for independent tasks is polynomial
    complete, and hence unlikely to admit of a non-enumerative

    <text>the next 700 programming languages a family of
    unimplemented computing languages is described that is intended
    to span differences of application area by a unified framework.
    this framework dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined
    names, and the conventions about characterizing functional
    relationships. within this framework the design of a specific
    language splits into two independent parts. one is the choice
    of written appearances of programs (or more generally, their
    physical representation). the other is the choice of the
    abstract entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists of
    them, functional relations among them) that can be referred to
    in the language. the system is biased towards "expressions"
    rather than "statements." it includes a nonprocedural(purely
    functional) subsystem that aims to expand the class of users'
    needs that can be met by a single print-instruction, without
    sacrificing the important properties that make conventional
    right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.

    given an area of storage containing scattered, marked nodes of

    described here which accomplishes this task in linear time
    relative to the size of the storage area, and in a space of the
    order of one bit for each pointer. the algorithm operates by
    reversibly encoding the situation (that a collection of
    locations point to a single location) by a linear list,
    emanating from the pointed-to location, passing through the
    pointing locations, and terminating with the pointed-to
    location's transplanted contents. august, 1978 morris, f.l.

    libraries in the 1960s use of the term 'documentation' has
    become more frequently applied to certain tasks in all types of
    libraries. it is therefore unrealistic to consider
    librarianship and documentation as separate disciplines. at the

    <text>national-level cooperative reference services' a
    reaction. paper presented as a reaction to previous speeches at
    the reference and adult services division cooperative reference
    service committee programme at the american library association
    annual conference, san francisco, 29 june 81. puts the point of
    view of oregan state library regarding its involvement in the
    library of congress reference correspondence referral programme
    (2see1 82/5808) and briefly discusses the services provided by
    the slavic reference service at the university of illinois
    (2see1 82/5812) and the british library lending division.
    concludes that if a national-level referral system is not to be
    overloaded with inappropriate requests that unnecessarily
    increase the costs, there must be adequate local reference
    services available to all us residents and a public awareness
    of these local services.</text>

    studied so far are not those which are really important, and
    further suggests that there is a great deal of confusion and
    misconceptions surrounding debate on document delivery. some
    factors are proposed for examination which are more fundamental
    to the design of document delivery systems.</text>

    will be able to obtain explicit answers from a large relational
    database of aircraft flight and maintenance data using a system
    called planes. the design and implementation of this system is
    described and illustrated with detailed examples of the
    operation of system components and examples of overall system
    operation. the language processing portion of the system uses a
    number of augmented transition networks, each of which matches
    phrases with a specific meaning, along with context registers
    (his tory keepers) and concept case frames; these are used for
    judging meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for
    clarifying partially understood questions, and resolving
    ellipsis and pronoun reference problems. other system
    components construct a formal query for the relational
    database, and optimize the order of searching relations.
    methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions
    and for providing browsing ability. also included are
    discussions of important issues in programming natural language
    systems for limited domains, and the relationship of this
    system to others. july, 1978 waltz, d.l. question answering,

    under these conditions the primal-dual method shows a

    that the relevant parameters in determining the difference in
    the number of iterations between the algorithms is not only the

    <text>children's literature in english' a select, annotated
    bibliography, 1835-1935. since the 1950s the study of
    children's literature has developed into an autonomous academic
    discipline. research institutes and information centres as well
    as societies and associations in the field have proliferated.
    several scholarly periodicals are devoted entirely to
    children's literature. current academic interest in children's
    literature has been reflected in the growing number of
    dissertations and theses for advanced degrees. this tendency is
    also discernable in south africa. an information centre for
    children's literature and media (iskemus) was established at
    the university of stellenbosch in 1978. potchefstroom has an
    institute for research in children's literature which has
    already held 2 country-wide symposia and has had a book
    published under its auspices by tafelberg. academic study of
    the genre necessitates the formation of collections of
    children's books and media reflecting the personal bias an d
    interest of the researchers. such collection building has
    become increasingly difficult because investors regard fine
    children's books as sound financial investments because of
    their scarcity. at stellenbosch a private collection of about
    1,000 books reflects the cultural influence of mainly victorian
    english middle-class juvenile reading matter, 1830-1930. a very
    brief indication of some of the interesting items is reflected
    in the select, annotated abstract of the catalogue of

    to develop electronic mail services insofar as they enhance

    should be managed by an independent unit within the postal
    service, and continued market research will be needed to

    examines in greater depth the current situation. the national
    library (founded 1900), its function, organisational structure,
    policies and the work of its departments are described. public
    libraries began to grow at the beginning of this century; a
    coordinated public library network was established in 1949. the
    largest university library is that of the university of the
    philippines (founded 1908). its rich collections are the basis
    for retrospective national bibliographies compiled by the
    library. the work of special and government libraries is also
    noted, followed by the provision of library education and the

    <text>shallow binding in lisp 1.5 shallow binding is a scheme
    which allows the value of a variable to be accessed in a
    bounded amount of computation. an elegant model for shallow
    binding in lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is
    an environment tree transformation called rerooting. rerooting
    is completely general and reversible, and is optional in the
    sense that a lisp 1.5 interpreter will operate correctly
    whether or not rerooting is invoked one very context change.
    since rerooting leaves assoc [v, a] invariant, for all
    variables v and all environments a, the programmer can have
    access to a rerooting primitive, shallow[], which gives him
    dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or deep, and
    which affects only the speed of execution of a program, not its
    semantics. in addition, multiple processes can be active in the
    same environment structure, so long as rerooting is an
    indivisible operation. finally, the concept of rerooting is
    shown to combine the concept of shallow binding in lisp with
    dijkstra's display for algol and hence is a general model for
    shallow binding. july, 1978 baker, h.g. jr. lisp 1.5,

    <text>a fast string searching algorithm an algorithm is
    presented that searches for the location, "i," of the first
    occurrence of a character string, "pat," in another string,
    "string." during the search operation, the characters of pat
    are matched starting with the last character of pat. the
    information gained by starting the match at the end of the
    pattern often allows the algorithm to proceed in large jumps
    through the text being searched. thus the algorithm has the
    unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first i
    characters of string are inspected. the number of characters
    actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of
    the length of pat. for a random english pattern of length 5,
    the algorithm will typically inspect i/4 characters of string
    before finding a match at i. furthermore, the algorithm has
    been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen
    machine instructions are executed. these conclusions are
    supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of
    the average behavior of the algorithm. the worst case behavior
    of the algorithm is linear in i+patlen, assuming the
    availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus
    the size of the alphabet. october, 1977 boyer, r. s.

    <text>subexpression ordering in the execution of arithmetic
    expressions an arithmetic expression can often be broken down
    into its component subexpressions. depending on the hardware
    environment in which the expression is to be executed, these
    subexpressions can be evaluated in serials, in parallel, or in
    a combination of these modes. this paper shows that expression
    execution time can be minimized only if consideration is given
    to the ordering of the subexpressions. in particular,
    subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing memory
    and processor time requirements. this observation is valid for
    configurations ranging from a uniprocessor with an unbuffered
    main memory to multiprocessor with a "cache" buffer memory. if
    the number of subexpressions which can be executed in parallel
    exceeds the number of available processors, then execution of
    some of these subexpressions must be postponed. a procedure is
    given which combines this requirement with the earlier ordering
    considerations to provide an optimal execution sequence. july,

    <text>description of basic algorithm in detab/65 preprocessor
    the basic algorithm for the conversion of decision tables into
    cobol code is contained in the generator portion of the
    detab/65 preprocessor. the generator analyzes a decision table
    and produces simple cobol conditional statements. core storage
    is saved by using queueing techniques and extensive indexing
    and also by outputting the code as it is generated, a line at a
    time. the only optimization attempted is the elimination of
    obviously unnecessary tests on certain conditions in the
    decision table. since the preprocessor and this language
    associated with it were developed for cobol users, the
    preprocessor was written in a modular form in required
    cobol-61. july, 1967 callahan, m. d. chapman, a. e. ca670709 jb

    <text>remarks on the pre-print of rak-wb. the rak-wb (regeln
    fur die alphabetische katalogisierung in 'wissenschaftlichen
    bibliotheken')-rules for alphabetical cataloguing in research
    libraries-have been compiled to correspond to the specific
    situation in research libraries and fulfil their purpose which
    is to bridge the time gap until rak is published in book form.
    rak-wb provides a basis for cataloguing in research libraries
    demonstrating the desired uniformity in all important points.
    its use will lead to uniform processing at all stages of
    classification which is necessary for cooperative cataloguing
    and data exchange. its value is increased by the many
    amendments and improvements which went into its make-up as a
    result of years of practical experience with rak. rak-wb has
    been quickly adopted by the rapidly expanding library
    associations. it is hoped that the planned rak-ob for public
    libraries will be of a comparable standard.</text>

    education which would establish a base for the effective
    planning and coordination of world wide activities in and
    related to the education of librarians and information
    specialists. this structure is centred on a coordinating
    council (cc) and a standing conference of library educators

    <text>school libraries and basic education in first and second
    grade schools in the state of sao paulo, brazil. discusses the
    role of the library in elementary and junior high schools as
    prescribed by brazilian state legislation, and suggests closer
    integration of school and library tasks. details are given of
    the structure of school organisation, which assigns the library
    to the category of technical support for teaching programmes
    and designates it an extra-curricular activity. criticises this
    as an inadequate conception of the library's role, and argues
    for active collaboration in the teaching process, as a back-up
    multi-media resource centre. examines the official functions of
    the library, and shows how insufficient resources are provided
    for the fulfilment of even its nominal tasks. in conclusion a
    restructuring of the school system is proposed, permitting
    total integration of library and teaching programmes at all
    levels.</text>

    <text>precision searching with the condor information system.
    condor (communication in natural language with dialogue
    oriented retrieval systems) developed by siemens since 1972, is
    an information system for processing structured and
    unstructured information. its precision search system makes
    possible a search for terms and also for terminological
    connections within a text. descriptions are included of'
    precision searching components, such as linguistic analysis;
    formation of analysis results into g-networks; discovery of
    relevant textual points assisted by 4 relevance functions; and
    retrieval dialogue. all components are being tested in the
    context of an office information system and a system on work
    safety; the system will begin operating during the
    1980s.</text>

    systems range from a conversation machine to programs which
    make sentences about pictures and systems which translate from
    english into logical calculi. systems are classified as
    list-structured data-based, graphic data-based, text-based and
    inferential. principles and methods of operations are detailed
    and discussed. it is concluded that the data-base
    question-answer has passed from initial research into the early
    developmental phase. the most difficult and important research
    questions for the advancement of general-purpose language
    processors are seen to be concerned with measuring, dealing
    with ambiguities, translating into formal languages and

    as factors in human culture. they are a country's most valuable
    asset. librarianship should become a university subject as it
    evolves the best methods of disseminating knowledge.
    librarianship needs to study the work of people's and public
    libraries, library history, statistics, book conservation,
    library buildings and staff training. libraries must help all
    those turning to them as a school. however, untrained staff

    <text>the expanding world of computers the onward sweep of
    automatic processing of information is impeded by nine
    principal barriers: geography, cost, problem complexity,
    man-machine communication, inadequate sensors, lack of
    understanding, distance, time, and size. the main incentive for
    breaching these barriers is the universal need for processing
    information, ever more urgent as the greater part of human work
    activity changes from production to service. computer
    developments in hardware, programming, time-sharing, education,
    data communication, and displays are judged by how effectively
    they remove these barriers, and their barrier-smashing
    potentialities indicate continued rapid expansion.
    problem-oriented languages are particularly effective over the
    entire front. online computers and time-sharing also rate high
    by this measure. education and increased understanding are
    basic to all progress with the computer. this complex but
    powerful tool is the most important one available to
    governments and scientists to use in studying the problems
    being created by the population explosion, and in analyzing
    possible solutions. april, 1968 harder, e. l. barriers,

    <text>in the shadow of the black krone. reports on the swedish
    library association's annual meeting in kiruna, june 81.
    libraries were accused of fixating on loan figures and
    neglecting quality. protests against cuts in library
    expenditure and calls for a library law have come from
    publishers, authors and trade unions, as well as librarians.
    but the public library commission's remit does not include
    proposals for a law, nor may it recommend action which involves
    further expenditure. it is foremost an examination of the
    status quo. it hopes to draw on the findings of the dala
    project, a literature campaign starting in autumn 81. an
    account of the videogram commission's work was given; stress
    was laid on the positive aspects of video, such as greater
    availability of rare and unpopular films and aids for
    minorities. a distribution network for serious video production
    involving libraries was called for. a resolution against the
    introduction of lending fees and for a library law was rejected
    as unani mity among representatives was lacking.</text>

    while information control and document access techniques have
    benefited from the introduction of automated information
    retrieval systems and developments in information technology,
    it is on the quality of information input that the efficiency
    of automated systems depends. information processing should be
    integrated into the procedures for systems organisation and
    administration, and linked directly to information
    dissemination services. the chief factor governing quality of
    system input is information analysis, and in
