    <text>alphabetization in indexes: experimental studies.
    discusses the respective advantages of the 'letter by letter'
    and 'word by word' system of alphabetisation, and presents the
    results of several studies of how students and children
    sequence words and retrieve items from indexes with different
    sequences. concludes that students use a variety of methods
    when asked to put words in order for an index, with sense and
    meaning being a prime consideration. schoolchildren, however,
    were found to be less ambitious in this respect, and to order
    words alphabetically using the letter by letter method. no 1
    method of sequencing indexes was found to lead to better
    retrieval than any of the others used, and it appears that
    either of the 2 methods currently used by indexers can be
    employed without causing undue difficulty for young
    readers.</text>

    <text>children, libraries and comics in mexico. describes a

    in guadelajara briefly. the children's library attached to the
    'centro social morelos' in aguascalientes suffers from lack of
    space and material, and the unqualified librarian's main duty
    is to keep order. few public libraries lend books. the stream
    of pulp magazines and comics for adults and children is now
    being countered by the state, who publishes material in similar
    style, but better content. the library in san cristobal
    receives money for staff salaries but none for books. like
    other libraries, biblioteca de mexico is used mainly by
    students. the public library service came on a more organised
    footing in 1978, and as no school libraries exist, creation of
    children's sections is receiving priority. there is great
    demand for the librarians trained at the 6 universities but
    many are attracted into private firms. continuity of library
    planning is hampered by the changes of central administration

    <text>the invisible library. argues that the neglect of pr
    activities by public libraries has led to an increasing lack of
    understanding of their basic aims among politicians and a
    consequent reduction in their budgets. the library service
    occupies a modest place in the public debate compared to other
    sectors because it has no competitors and the public lacks a
    basis for comparison. library matters get little publicity
    either in the national, local or professional press. actions by
    user groups, especially if these are generally respected
    citizens, can be very effective and contact with organisations
    such as the chamber of commerce and the trade unions should be
    nurtured by the library. this could take the form of 'friends
    of the library groups, as found largely in the usa, or, more in
    line with danish practice, user councils.</text>

    <text>minicomputers and available packages. developments in the
    computer field in recent years are described with particular
    emphasis on the facilities available for the mechanisation of
    library and information tasks. with the development of
    minicomputers a new era opened up for information workers but a
    major problem had to be overcome, namely the lack of suitable
    software to provide those facilities. following the
    introduction of ibm's stairs program for information storage
    and retrieval on a large mainframe computer, similar programs
    soon became available for use on the range of minicomputers
    which had started to penetrate the market. many were specially
    commissioned for library and information use; discusses cairs
    and status. a major breakthrough came with the introduction of
    word processors, particularly the programmable shared logic
    systems. manufacturers started to produce specific software
    packages, including information storage and retrieval programs,
    for this type of equipment. examples of relevant hardware and
    software and various applications are given.</text>

    <text>the impact of warfare on the rate of invention' a time
    series analysis of united states activity. the outbreak of war
    is generally thought to shift the fields in which research is
    conducted. as a result, military conflict has historically been
    credited with being the catalyst which has caused decisive
    technological advances. it is also generally suggested that
    warfare has a systematic impact on the intensity of inventive
    activity. most scholars have claimed that wars increase
    inventiveness, although a few argue that conflict is a
    hinderance to research. this question has not received
    extensive empirical examination. using us data, a basic pattern
    is repeatedly observed. immediately after the outbreak of a
    war, there is a significant decline in inventiveness, which is
    followed by a marked surge. the average net result is a virtual
    negation of the 2 trends.</text>

    interference the structure of shared memory in a multiprocessor

    and it is shown that a home memory organization, in which each
    processor is associated with one or more memories in which its
    address space is concentrated, is quite effective in reducing
    memory in terference. home memory organization is shown to be
    particularly suited to certain specialized computation problems
    as well as to possess advantages in terms of in terference and
    reliability for general purpose computation. results for in

    <text>the programme for library research completed. the library
    high school's working party on library research has now
    completed its work and drawn up a programme. the background to
    the work was the reform of higher education in 1977, which
    encouraged research, giving priority to' development of
    foundation courses which encourage the students to make use of
    new research results, further training of lecturers, and
    improvement of facilities for lecturers to follow current
    research. the working party at its 1st meeting in aug 78
    adopted these guidelines' to examine existing educational plans
    to see how far they promote student use of library research; to
    establish contact with international research; to promote
    research skills among teachers of librarianship; to initiate
    research projects. a permanent seminar for library research was
    set up in 1978 and participants were sent on courses and
    conferences. an examination of on-going library-relevant
    research in swedish scientific institutions was made and to
    facilitate the monitoring of this research a computer based
    index' nordic bdi index, has been created. it remains to plan a
    course bridging the training of librarians and researchers in

    <text>interference between communicating parallel processes
    various kinds of interference between communicating parallel
    processes have been examined by dijkstra, knuth, and others.
    solutions have been given for the mutual exclusion problem and
    associated subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and
    informal proofs of correctness have been given for these
    solutions. in this paper a system of parallel processes is
    regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state s (i.e. a
    collection of pertinent data values and process configurations)
    to a next state s' in accordance with a transition rule s
    --&gt; s'. a set of such rules yields sequences of states,
    which dictate the system's behavior. the mutual exclusion
    problem and the associated subproblems are formulated as
    questions of inclusion between sets of states, or of the
    existence of certain sequences. a mechanical proof procedure is
    shown, which will either verify (prove the correctness of ) or
    discredit (prove the incorrectness of) an attempted solution,
    with respect to any of the interference properties. it is shown
    how to calculate transition rules from the "partial rules" by
    which the individual processes operate. the formation of
    partial rules and the calculation of transition rules are both
    applicable to hardware processes as well as to software
    processes, and symmetry between processes is not required.

    <text>the legal position of polytechnic ('fachhochschul-')
    libraries after the new polytechnic (university) laws. in 1979
    new university laws were passed which affected polytechnic
    ('fachhochschul-') laws and the legal position of polytechnic
    libraries. although polytechnics differ in form slightly from
    one state to another within west germany, there are some
    general points in the new laws which influence polytechnic
    libraries in the same way. the status of the libraries has
    become more precise; they are recognised as central working
    units. the libraries now have the right to make decisions
    concerning budget expenditure and the allocation of new staff.
    the polytechnic library has thus become an independent
    institution with its own duties and rights within the
    polytechnic. however, libraries still depend on the size of
    allocations from the central polytechnic bodies. final
    decisions on the choice of literature acquisition can still
    only be made by the relevant polytechnic department with the li
    brary merely acting in an advisory capacity.</text>

    programs need not be generated by a compiler and in fact could
    be hand coded. examples of the usefulness of such a system are
    given. some interesting results are the ability to handle
    programs that implement recursion by bypassing the start of the
    program, and the detection and pinpointing of a wide class of
    errors in the low level language programs. the examples
    demonstrate that optimization of the genre of this paper can

    <text>dramatic rise in the number of censorship cases.
    interviews judith f. krug, leader of the american library
    association's office for intellectual freedom. its work is
    based on the first amendment of the u.s. constitution and on
    the ala's library bill of rights. it began as the intellectual
    freedom committee in 1940. until recently almost all cases came
    from school libraries, but since the reagan administration took
    office the most important cases originate with the public
    libraries. the office, however, does not confine itself to
    taking up cases within the library sector, but it keeps
    librarians and the public informed of the importance of the
    first amendment, issues publications, and holds seminars. many
    attempts at censorship come from the moral majority movement.
    the office finds it easier to deal with libraries which have a
    clearly formulated selection policy, and in very few cases does
    it recommend refusal to acquire a particular book. the legal
    side of ala is dealt with by a separate, but related body, the

    there are 4,000 libraries in moscow, out of which 3,000 are
    mass libraries, children's libraries, school libraries and
    trade union libraries. the rest are scientific libraries. the
    soviet cataloguing centre receives 15 free copies of all the
    books published in the ussr. all books, newspapers, and
    periodicals are catalogued there, about 45,000 books a year in
    all. a national bibliography is produced. scientific libraries
    are the main beneficiaries of the centralised service. isbn is
    not used yet, but issn is, and a translation programme is being

    <text>logic and programming languages logic has been long in
    terested in whether answers to certain questions are computable
    in principle, since the outcome puts bounds on the
    possibilities of formalization. more recently, precise
    comparisons in the efficiency of decision methods have become
    available through the developments in complexity theory. these,
    however, are applications to logic, and a big question is
    whether methods of logic have significance in the other
    direction for the more applied parts of computability theory.
    programming languages offer an obvious opportunity as their
    syntactic formalization is well advanced; however, the
    semantical theory can hardly be said to be complete. though we
    have many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging
    mathematical answers to these queries: what is a machine? what
    is a computable process? how (or how well) does a machine
    simulate a process? programs naturally enter in giving
    descriptions of processes. the definition of the precise
    meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the
    objects of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
    and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). so far the
    theories of automata and of nets, though most in teresting for
    dynamics, have formalized only a portion of the field, and
    there has been perhaps too much concentration on the
    finite-state and algebraic aspects. it would seem that the
    understanding of higher-level program features involves us with
    infinite objects and forces us to pass through several levels
    of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final
    simulation on a real machine. these levels can be made
    mathematically exact if we can find the right abstractions to
    represent the necessary structures. the experience of many
    independent workers with the method of data types as lattices
    (or partial orderings) under an information content ordering,
    and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
    flexibility of this approach in providing definitions and
    proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence on
    implementations. nevertheless much remains to be done in
    showing how abstract conceptualizations can (or cannot) be
    actualized before we can say we have a unified theory.

    are no library laws guaranteeing financial provision, public
    libraries will be counted among the 'voluntary'
    responsibilities of local government, which are particularly
    affected in times of recession. library planning is described
    within the context of general municipal administration,
    including the importance of establishing priorities and of
    library cooperation with other local government departments,
    especially those concerned with organisation, personnel and
    finance. many important problems must be solved before new
    projects can be carried out and possible alternatives must be
    tested.</text>

    <text>what can the public library do to increase literacy?. the
    public library is traditionally regarded as a resource for
    culturally advanced and literate people. south africa has both
    developed and developing communities. while the public library
    usually focuses on the needs of established readers, there is a
    substantial case for providing innovative forms of service to
    illiterate and neo-literate communities, and for actually
    promoting literacy through the library. the concept of literacy
    is discussed in terms of the developed and developing sectors,
    and literacy is placed in its cultural context. the problems of
    semi-illiteracy among educated people are seen as part of the
    spectrum of illiteracy, which extends from formally educated
    people with poor reading ability to uneducated rural dwellers.
    the role of the public library with regard to literacy across
    the spectrum is discussed, with specific suggestions given for
    tasks which the public library can undertake to promote
    literacy.</text>

    <text>further remarks on line segment curve-fitting using
    dynamic programming in a recent paper, bellman showed how
    dynamic programming could be used to determine the solution to
    a problem previously considered by stone. the problem comprises
    the determination, given n, of the n points of subdivision of a
    given interval (a,b) and the corresponding line segments, that
    give the best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the
    interval. bellman confined himself primarily to the analytical
    derivation, suggesting briefly, however, how the solution of
    the equation derived for each particular point of subdivision
    u(i) could be reduced to a discrete search. in this paper, the
    computational procedure is considered more fully, and the
    similarities to some of stone's equations are indicated. it is
    further shown that an equation for u(i) involving no
    minimization may be found. in addition, it is shown how
    bellman's method may be applied to the curve-fitting problem
    when the additional constraints are added that the ends of the
    line segments must be on the curve. august, 1962 gluss, b.

    <text>the measurement of term importance in automatic indexing.
    the frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a

    content analysis and indexing purposes. in particular, very
    rare or very frequent terms are normally believed to be less
    effective than medium-frequency terms. recently automatic
    indexing theories have been devised that use not only the term
    frequency characteristics but also the relevance properties of
    the terms. the major term-weighting theories are 1st briefly
    reviewed. the term precision and term utility weights that are
    based on the occurrence characteristics of the terms in the
    relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant, documents of a
    collection are then introduced. methods are suggested for
    estimating the relevance properties of the terms based on their
    overall occurrence characteristics in the collection. finally,
    experimental evaluation results are shown comparing the
    weighting systems using the term relevance properties with the
    more conventional frequency-based methodologies.</text>

    education for tutor librarians are discussed. when reviewing
    the capacity of the school it is clear that it has not
    responded well to the changing labour market, sometimes
    producing over-, sometimes undercapacity. criticises the plans
    for several shorter training courses as they might reduce
    interest in the 2-year librarianship course. discusses also
    whether the education for librarianship should be general with
    specialisation after a foundation course, as the student
    representatives want, or whether specialised courses should be
    available earlier, and argues for more librarians with special
    knowledge of administration, information work, and outreach

    <text>a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the
    computer in many computer operating systems a user
    authenticates himself by entering a secret password known
    solely to himself and the system. the system compares this
    password with one recorded in a password table which is
    available to only the authentication program. the integrity of
    the system depends on keeping the table secret. in this paper a
    password scheme is presented which does not require secrecy in
    the computer. all aspects of the system, including all relevant
    code and data bases, may be known by anyone attempting to
    intrude. the scheme is based on using a function h which the
    would-be intruder is unable to invert. this function is applied
    to the user's password and the result compared to a table
    entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of the user.
    the intruder may know all about h and have access to the table,
    but he can penetrate the system only if he can invert h to
    determine an input that produces a given output. this paper
    discusses issues surrounding selection of a suitable h. two
    different plausible arguments are given that penetration would
    be exceedingly difficult, and it is then argued that more
    rigorous results are unlikely. finally, some human engineering
    problems relating to the scheme are discussed. august, 1974

    <text>book clubs and authors' royalties. in the netherlands
    bookclubs have recently been severely criticised by authors for
    paying much smaller royalties than the normal booktrade. the
    1st bookclub in the netherlands was founded in 1937 and there
    are now 6 registered clubs with a total membership of approx. 1
    1/2 million members. the market share of the bookclubs in the
    netherlands has risen from 2% in 1966 to 24% in 1980. the
    removal of the collective price agreement on books would also
    be disastrous for the smaller bookshops and publishers and for
    lesser-known authors. booksellers and publishers must now come
    to a trading arrangement with the bookclubs. it is, however,

    <text>integrating micrographics with word processing. in 1974,

    of eye-readable materials, magnetic tape for quick retrieval of
    machine-readable storage, and microform for long-term storage.
    maintaining compatibility among the 3 storage systems became a

    list structures. the main data manipulations to be performed in
    automatic information systems are first briefly reviewed. a
    variety of data representations which have been used to
    describe structured information are then examined, and the
    characteristics of various processing languages are outlined in
    the light of the procedures requiring implementation.
    advantages of these programming languages for the retrieval
    application are examined, and suggestions are made for the
    design of programming facilities to aid in information
    retrieval. march, 1966 salton, g. ca660315 jb march 3, 1978

    <text>the use of photocomposition and filmsetting for the
    computerised production of information media. there are many
    ways of processing textual and other forms of information, for
    photocomposition and filmsetting through the use of eser
    computers; various methods for using these techniques, based on
    the comprehensive performance range of the equipment, are
    described. firstly, a simple example of typesetting is
    described to illustrate the technical processes and the
    typographically new qualitative characteristics of modern
    photocopying and filmsetting equipment. the eser setting
    programme, developed jointly by the data processing centre in
    berlin and other interested bodies involved in printing and
    graphics, represents an excellent text processing programme
    system which is also available to outside users. the modular
    concept allows the rational use of photocomposition and
    filmsetting for production of a wide range of information media
    which can be adapted at low expense.</text>

    variables) other than that required to hold the original list
    and the copy. the original list is destroyed as it is moved. no
    mark bits are necessary, but pointers to the copy must be
    distinguishable from pointers to the original. the algorithm is
    superior in execution speed to previous algorithms for the same
    problem. some variations and extensions of the algorithm are

    <text>an application of heuristic search methods to edge and
    contour detection this paper presents a method for detecting
    edges and contours in noisy pictures. the properties of an edge
    are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge detection
    problem becomes the problem of minimizing the given figure of
    merit. this problem can be represented as a shortest path
    problem on a graph and can be solved using well-known graph
    search algorithms. the relations between this representation of
    the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are
    discussed, showing that the graph search method can lead to
    substantial improvements in computing time. moreover, if
    heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will
    depend on the amount of noise in the picture. some experimental
    results are given; these show how various information about the
    shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure
    of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy
    picture and the separation of touching objects. february, 1976

    research, educational and school libraries come under the
    ministry of education. but unlike the minority report, it
    suggests that no non-book materials and cultural activities
    should receive state support, and that it should be up to the
    individual authority whether to charge for these or finance
    them out of the local rates. exempted from this proposal should
    be lending of audio-visual materials to the disabled. it
    supports the independence of the local authority and its

    devoted to information seeking patterns of selected
    professionals. summarises the interview findings of the 5
    papers in this special section. each individual has his special
    information needs and each works in a field in which current
    information is both essential and often hard to locate.
    co-workers are the most often consulted information sources,
    and libraries were rarely if ever used for on the job
    needs-perhaps there is little or no role for the library in
    this sphere for many workers. library staff, too, consult
    co-workers when planning the library's reference activities.
    potential users know what they need. librarians need to know
    the extent to which they can fill those needs.</text>

    <text>preliminary investigation of techniques for automated
    reading of unformatted text methods for converting unstructured
    printed material into computer code are experimentally
    investigated. an operator-controlled mode, depending on human
    demarcation of the various regions of the page for guiding the
    scanner, is implemented by means of a joystick and a crt
    display. this mode, for which some performance figures are
    obtained, is thought to be suitable for processing very
    complicated material, such as technical journals. for simpler
    material, for instance the "claims" sections of patents, and in
    applications where the utmost accuracy is not necessary, an
    unsupervised mode is advocated. here, the textual portions of
    the page are located during a rapid prescan by a rudimentary
    form of frequency analysis. these areas are then rescanned at a
    higher resolution suitable for character recognition. error
    rates of the order of 0.1 percent are obtained in a simple
    problem involving photographs of telephone company meter
    boards. other matters related to the design of a general
    purpose page reader, such as the segmentation of printed text,
    the possibility of time-sharing the scanner, interactive
    man-machine operation, and the facsimile reproduction of
    illustrations, are discussed. july, 1968 nagy, g. pattern

    <text>dormant exchanges supported by a system of tokens; a
    suggestion. the term 'dormant exchange' describes an exchange
    system in which 1 library needs and obtains an item at a given
    time from another library but not vice versa. an exchange is
    still made, however, but on a credit system so that the other
    library can request desired material at a later date when the
    need arises, thus eliminating wasteful exchanges. the operation
    could be greatly simplified by the introduction of an
    internationally valid exchange token enabling a recipient
    library to pay for exchange material and a providing library to
    receive credit for what is supplied. it is conceded that
    valuation of tokens could be problematic.</text>

    <text>the cultural policy of local authorities. the text of a
    talk given to a conference on libraries in the icy wind of
    cultural policy, held in jarfalla, may 81. in order to
    influence cultural policy the cultural producers must inform
    themselves of the whole sphere of local politics. local
    authorities have no legal obligation to provide cultural
    activities and legislation laying down minimum standards for
    such activities, as in finland, should be enacted. after the
    boom in the 60s and 70s, the local authorities have to make
    cuts; as they cannot reduce previous capital investment they
    cut current expenditure on cultural activities such as schools
    and libraries, although money seems always available for sport,
    bureaucracy and data technology. the real power of
    decision-making lies not with the cultural, but with the
    executive committee, who is responsible for budgeting. cultural
    consumers should be as politically active as the pressure
    groups for sport and try to influence local politicians, if a
    catastrophe for culture is to be averted.</text>

    <text>save! that means again fewer books. the library
    inspectorate has examined public library accounts for 1981.
    these show an overall increase well within the savings
    circular's limit of 2% real growth. because of book price
    rises, acquisitions are likely to show an overall fall of 4%.
    the savings circular urged libraries to spend not more than 185
    kr. per inhabitant. it is difficult to determine what effect
    this statement has had, but a closer examination shows that the
    highest spenders, all in the copenhagen area, have cut down
    most. in the rest of the country part-time libraries show
    larger percentage increases than full-time libraries. only the
    southern jutland region show a considerable real increase in
    expenditure on materials. as staff salaries are subject to
    topping up if necessary, these do not suffer as much from cuts
    as material expenditure, and the prospect is one of libraries
    with outdated and worn books.</text>

    of libraries. these activities have been carried out in a great
    variety of ways, with each state reacting to its own
    demographic, governmental, and library realities. the federal
    library services and construction act has been a major
    constructive force enabling state library agencies to be
    effective leaders in cooperative and networking activities.
    state library agencies and public libraries working together
    can continue to extend library services by taking leadership in
    networking activities.</text>

    <text>optimal surface reconstruction from planar contours in
    many scientific and technical endeavors, a three-dimensional
    solid must be reconstructed from serial sections, either to aid
    in the comprehension of the object's structure or to facilitate
    its automatic manipulation and analysis. this paper presents a
    general solution to the problem of constructing a surface over
    a set of cross-sectional contours. this surface, to be composed
    of triangular tiles, is constructed by separately determining
    an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
    determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding
    certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph. a new
    fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized. also
    developed is a closed-form expression, in term of the number of
    contour poin ts, for an upper bound on the number of operations
    required to execute the algorithm. an illustrated example which
    involves the construction of a minimum area surface describing
    a human head is included. october, 1977 fuchs, h. kedem,z. m.

    <text>a model of memory contention in a paging machine this
    paper is concerned with certain aspects of contention for main
    memory resources in a multiprogrammed computer system operating
    under demand paging. in the model presented, the number of
    page-frames of main memory allocated to a problem program
    varies in time. these changes in memory configuration are
    represented explicitly in the model, cpu requirements and page
    exception characteristics of program material being described
    statistically. expressions for the distribution of the number
    of page-frames allocated to an executing program, the long run
    expected fraction of a program's execution time in a given
    number of page-frames, and the average execution interval of
    the multiprogrammed load are obtained. it is pointed out
    heuristically and demonstrated numerically that an increase is
    obtain able in the average execution interval of the
    multiprogrammed load over that resulting from equal fixed
    partitioning of main memory. august, 1972 oden, p. h. shedler,

    academic librarianship in the netherlands was criticised for
    the lack of a practical base. however, students following the
    course in academic librarianship at the p.a. tiele school of
    librianship in the hague receive lectures from practising
    academic librarians and the syllabus is reviewed annually in
    consultation with students and with staff from academic
    libraries. in addition the variety of posts in academic
    libraries open to students completing the course makes it
    impractical to suit the syllabus to a single type of library.
    it is also clear that too little is known about the course by

    <text>free access to reading' a new policy of opportunities.
    criticises the public library policy of dividing children's
    books according to age level as contrary to the reader's right
    to select material appropriate to his own abilities. draws on
    recent studies by brazilian researchers to establish that
    fluency in reading is a skill acquired progressively at an
    individual rate determined both by an increase in mechanical
    facility and the process of maturing. thus the reader's age
    does not necessarily correspond to his reading capacity, and
    artificial divisions imposed by libraries effectively prevent
    access to suitable material. the economic and social advantages
    of permitting free choice of books are discussed in relation to
    popularising libraries and maximising use of their
    resources.</text>

    trend towards decentralisation of administrative and technical
    support services in industrial organisations and the increasing
    use of automation in libraries will have a profound effect on
    the work of the information specialist. the professional
    organisations concerned with librarianship and information
    science must publicise the work of their members more
    effectively in the centres of higher education and at
    industrial management training courses. the information
    specialist must convince the management of his organisation
    that automation will not enable duties normally performed in
    the library to be taken over by technical staff. the
    information specialist must also be allowed to participate in

    proportional to (a). experimentation by robinson and lewis
    indicates that for small (a) the method suggested here also
    dominates methods recently suggested by dieter and ahrens,

    <text>library work is for the user' thoughts on the educational
    content of the subject group on library use. libraries in
    socialist societies are consciously oriented towards the user.
    important objectives of library work concerning library use
    are' the continuous development of cultural and educational
    needs; development of an awareness of social needs; and planned
    stimulation of the need for new literature and information. the
    subject group on library use supplies students with the
    necessary knowledge and skills to use the socio-political
    aspect of entire library activity and adapt it to meet the
    social needs of the user. library use falls under 2 main
    headings' use in the library itself and external use, the
    lending system. other important features of library use are'
    library regulations forming part of the civil law; the lending
    system, how to make it most effective for the user and user
    education courses which should be organised by libraries to
    improve the users' knowledge of the library s ystem.</text>

    <text>a heuristic problem solving design system for equipment
    or furniture layouts the designer problem solver (dps)
    demonstrates that the computer can perform simple design tasks.
    in particular, it designs furniture and equipment layouts. this
    task was chosen because it is simple, well defined, and
    characteristic of many design tasks in architecture,
    engineering, urban planning, and natural resource management.
    these space planning tasks usually involve manipulating
    two-dimensional representations of objects to create feasible
    or optimal solutions for problems involving topological and
    metric spatial constraints. the paper describes extensive tests
    performed on the program. dps is a heuristic problem solver
    with a planning phase prefixed to it. it uses the planning
    process to give it a sense of direction, diagnostic procedures
    to locate difficulties, and remedial actions to recover from
    difficulties. it uses a convex polygon representation to
    accurately describe the objects and the layout. this
    representation allows topological and metric constraints to be
    tested and the design to be easily updated. dps has been
    applied to 50 problems. while it is slow and limited in scope,
    the ideas behind it are general. it demonstrates the need for
    selectivity in controlling search and the methods used to
    achieve it: task-specific information, planning, diagnostic
    procedures, remedial actions, and selective alternative
    generators. may, 1975 pfefferkorn, c. e. artificial

    <text>even after 8 years within the colleges of technology,
    librarianship training is still a crisis area. although

    each west german state is responsible for its own education
    system, therefore considerable variations still exist
    concerning legal status of library schools, entry requirements,
    curricula for compulsory and optional subjects and organisation
    of courses for public and academic librarians. some subjects
    are not taught at all in some schools and generally related
    subjects are split up too much. many lecturers place too much
    emphasis on formal lectures' many students are uninterested in
    their studies. training courses must develop students' critical
    faculties, encourage creativity and promote active
    communication with readers and cooperation with other
    institutions; better organisation and more unification among
    library schools are required.</text>

    <text>legibility aspects of coded online information. on-line

    these flags are needed to assist the output device in
    presenting the material in the best possible way according to

    <text>how can your son become a reader?. the moscow and tul'sk

    read little and were indifferent to fiction. the

    here children learn to examine books carefully before deciding
    on selection. after 6 months of this instruction, 65% of
    1st-formers were quickly able to find the books required. the
    method is supplemented by reading aloud stories about the text,
    literary games, competitions, etc. the aim is to familiarise
    1st to 3rd-formers with some of the best russian, soviet and
    foreign literature. librarians should consolidate on these

    libraries was carried out in 1970, 1974, and 1978. from the
    average of 100 special libraries 13 were medical libraries.
    holdings in the analysed special libraries amounted to 28.5
    million volumes in 1970, to 43.6 million in 1974, and to 51.5
    million volumes in 1978. increases 1970-74 amounted to 15
    million volumes while acquisitions decreased to 8 million
    volumes 1974-78. comparison with other data revealed that
    during the early 70s holdings in local, institutional,
    libraries had been augmented to a larger extent than in the 2nd
    half of the decade. the same trend was valid for the 13 medical
    libraries.</text>

    <text>a policy-driven scheduler for a time-sharing system the
    service received by a process from a time-sharing operating
    system can be characterized by a resource count sum{w[i]r[ij]}
    where r[ij] is the number of units of service received by
    process i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
    service. each class of users can be characterized by a policy
    function which specifies the amount of service a user who
    belongs to this class should receive as a function of time.
    priority changes dynamically as a function of the difference
    between the service promised to the user by the policy function
    and the service he actually receives. a scheduling and swapping
    algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process above
    its policy function will provide the specified level of
    service. overhead can be reduced by avoiding swaps of process
    which have received at least his level of service. the
    algorithm has been implemented in a general purpose operating
    system, and it has provided significantly better service to
    interactive and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler.

    <text>a rationalist's critique of book selection for academic
    libraries. academic library collections have, historically,
    been selected by the faculty of the institution which they
    library serves. recently, however, much responsibility for
    collection development has devolved upon librarians who are
    eager to retain and amplify their role in this area. arguments
    presented in favour of lodging collection development
    responsiblity with librarians are, however, less than
    convincing and ignore important realities to make their case.
    librarians often confuse the ability to select books with
    accountability for such selection. argues that book selection
    is more properly and more adequately done by faculty members
    than librarians, and suggests a way of dealing with the problem
    of accountability often encountered when faculty are
    responsible for selection.</text>

    <text>a software design and evaluation system a critical
    failure of current software system design and implementation
    methodology is that the performance of a proposed design is not
    evaluated before it is actually implemented. in this paper the
    reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
    which overcomes many of the difficulties is proposed. a system
    which integrates performance evaluation with design and
    implementation is described. this system is based on a simple,
    high level language which is used to describe the evolving
    system at all stages of its development. the source language
    description is used as direct input to performance analysis and
    simulation routines. using the performance information obtained
    from these routines as feedback, the problems which adversely
    affect performance are detected early enough so that they can
    be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the
    proposed system. february, 1973 graham, r. m. clancy, g. j. jr.

    <text>digital synthesis of correlated stationary noise in this
    note we propose a method of generating stationary noise with a
    prescribed auto-covariance function by digital methods. the
    need for such a technique often arises in testing the
    performance of data processing and engineering systems, where
    inputs corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) are
    required. the technique is quite simple and produces
    strict-sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with
    r(t), the prescribed auto-covariance function (acf), over an
    interval [-t(0), t(0)]. the method consists of approximating
    the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines,
    and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and
    appropriate amplitudes. in order to simplify discussion of the
    statistical properties of the noise generated, the technique is
    first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis. in
    practice, discrete harmonic analysis as presented in the third
    section is used. july, 1962 peabody, p. r. adorno, d. s.

    information retrieval can only be effected through the
    restricted approaches permitted by standard reductive
    cataloguing codes. attempts to apply conventional cataloguing
    procedures to audio-visual material require the transcription
    of images and sounds into textual equivalents, for integration
    with the existing collection of written documents. searching by
    purely visual or audio qualities is impossible. equally,

    <text>the bibliographic situation and the national periodical
    catalogue, (part) 1' under the aegis of the library centre. in
    1954, a bibliographic joint committee was set up, whose task
    was to coordinate danish bibliographic publishing and initiate
    bibliographies where needed. it was to advise the library
    centre through participation in long term planning. in reality,
    control was left to the publishers and initiatives for new
    publications to individuals, international bodies and pressure
    groups. this situation is unlikely to change until the library
    commission's proposal for establishment of a national
    bibliographic council with responsibility for control of the
    national bibliography and state financing has been implemented.
    as long as the library centre has monopoly on production, it
    can dictate that libraries must pay high prices or else make do
    with fewer and inferior bibliographies. the librarians' union
    has therefore called for nationalisation of the national
    bibliography with free distribu tion to libraries.</text>

    <text>a new concept for the design of a flexible office system.
    presents office automation systems as an application of
    microprocessor based systems. the small size, low cost, and
    reasonably high power of these systems enabled their use in
    automating some office tasks. presents a general description of
    a typical microprocessor based office automation system, then
    discusses the problems arising in the design, implementation,
    and use of such systems. proposes a scheme for partitioning and
    modularising the hardware and software of the system, taking
    into consideration the solution of some problems of
    compatibility, portability and system extensibility. the
    proposed system can be used as a universal basic core on which
    one can easily build larger word processing systems. the user
    can, by himself, extend his system by using the same word
    processing language he uses everyday because of its special
    properties presented here. the system is also simply
    reconfigurable at the will of the user to exactly fi t his

    library buildings, the actual library is accommodated above the

    <text>a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key
    cryptosystems an encryption method is presented with the novel
    property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not
    thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. this has two
    important consequences: (1) couriers or other secure means are
    not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered
    using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended
    recipient. only he can decipher the message, since only he
    knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) a message can be
    "signed" using a privately held decryption key. anyone can
    verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed
    encryption key. signatures cannot be forged, and a signer
    cannot later deny the validity of his signature. this has
    obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic funds
    transfer" systems. a message is encrypted by representing it as
    a number m, raising m to a publicly specified power e, and then
    taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
    specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and
    q. decryption is similar;only a different, secret, power d is
    used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) * (q-1)). the security of the
    system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the
    published divisor, n. february, 1978 rivest, r.l. shamir, a.

    <text>a mathematical model for mechanical part description the

    common information requirements of computer-aided engineering
    drawing, numerical control tape generation, and physical
    characteristic computation. by judicious control of man-machine
    communication requirements, improved results over conventional
    engineering design processes are possible. an english-like
    input language, tailored for use by draftsmen and designers,
    will describe the part and specify the output desired. one
    approach to the mathematical model consists of a group of
    surface-defining quadric equations, which are created by a

    <text>danish school library association annual meeting 1981.
    report of a paper given at the 1981 annual meeting of denmark's
    school library association by lise ostergaard. the controversy
    over the transfer of responsibility for danish school libraries
    to the ministry of education from the ministry of culture is
    reviewed. it is the task of the local authorities, however, to
    ensure the operation and development of public and school
    libraries, so that they work together in promoting cultural,
    informational and educational activities. the change in the law
    governing school libraries is a step forward, strengthening
    cooperation between the various types of library controlled by
    central government and local authorities. production of books
    for children and young people is important and has increased
    greatly in denmark over the last 10-20 years, largely due to
    the expansion of children's libraries. 80% of all danish
    children's books are purchased by public, school and
    institutional libraries. the fut ure of such books depends on
    the willingness of local authorities, in spite of budgetary
    problems, to provide young people with a broad range of
    literature.</text>

    <text>a statistical analysis of the purchase and reading of
    books. statistics on the publication and sale of books in
    hungary reveal a large increase in the amount of material
    published since 1970, mostly produced by the 19 official
    publishers. book prices are relatively low; on average each
    individual buys 10 books per year. library purchases have
    doubled during the last 10 years, owing to improvements in
    schooling and the quick rise of the general cultural level. in
    the last 14 years the number of families owning books has
    doubled and the number of families owning more than 300 books
    has trebled. the amount of reading done has not increased at an
    equal rate because of television. more non-fiction is published
    and purchased than fiction, reflecting a general tendency

    special reference to the latin american situation, undertaken
    by ibict, the brazilian institute of scientific and

    explanation of basic terminology, the survey gives detailed
    accounts of recent national projects and developments, and of
    existing and projected international cooperative networks in
    europe and latin america. the conclusion compares the situation
    in developed countries, where government policy is to invest
    strongly in increasing efficiency of information services, with
    that in developing countries, where information resources are
    precarious and dependent on foreign technology, while
    government policy lacks determination in developing realistic

    contribute catalogue records via on-line visual display
    terminals direct to the central data base, from which output
    may be obtained in the form of catalogue cards, paper printout

    selection of material for constructions, for example, can best
    be described in data form is now internationally recognised
    with the creation of the international council of scientific
    unions' committee for scientific and technical data. luef
    distinguishes between retrieval of references and of data; very
    detailed specifications are needed to describe physical objects
    so that they can be referred to in a system. he studies the
    area of anticipative intelligence, i.e. the possibility of
    creating new solutions to a problem and thereby increase
    innovation within the firm. the theoretical discussions are
    soundly based on practical experience and he regards the
    process of retrieval as a tool to be used by the
    decision-maker. the thesis has sections on software and
    hardware, including discussion of the role of man in the search
    process. the 2nd part concerns practical system design in 4

    <text>improving locality by critical working sets a new
    approach to program locality improvement via restructuring is
    described. the method is particularly suited to those systems
    where primary memory is managed according to a working set
    strategy. it is based on the concept of critical working set, a
    working set which does not contain the next memory reference.
    the data the method operates upon are extracted from a trace of
    the program to be restructured. it is shown that, except in
    some special cases, the method is not optimum. however, the
    experimental results obtained by using the method to
    restructure an interactive text editor and the file system
    module of an operating system have shown its substantial
    superiority over the other methods proposed in the literature.

    <text>on-screen index. summary of an address given to the
    society of indexers, 20 nov 80. discusses the use of the
    prestel index which contains 170,000 pages of information
    provided by about 350 organisations. prestel is a 2-way
    viewdata system which, unlike the ceefax and oracle teletext
    systems, enables users to send reactions and messages to
    information providers. describes briefly the methods used to
    construct prestel's present index. notes the need for the use
    of multiple access methods and heavy cross referencing to allow
    for users' different internal classifications. indicates some
    future developments, including automated indexing using key

    <text>neater2: a pl/i source statement reformatter neater2
    accepts a pl/i source program and operates on it to produce a
    reformatted version. when in the logical mode, neater2
    indicates the logical structure of the source program in the
    indentation pattern of its output. logic errors discovered
    through neater2 logical analysis are discovered much more
    economically than is possible through compilation and trial
    runs. a number of options are available to give the user full
    control over the output format and to maximize the utility of
    neater2 as an aid during the early stages of development of a
    pl/i source deck. one option, usage, causes neater2 to insert
    into each logical unit of coding a statement which will case
    the number of times each one is executed to be recorded during
    execution. this feature is expected to provide a major aid in
    optimization of pl/i programs. november, 1970 conrow, k. smith,

    the case where and an extensive theory of triode oscillations
    has been built up for this case in practice however the graph
    of has a much flatter bottom than that of the function and
    cartwright of and of has raised the question whether this
    flattening will alter the performance of the circuit near

    this question an estimate is made of the permissible degree of
    flattening of the curve without the detuning diagram losing any
    of its significant properties various pertinent theorems are
    established and the possible periodic solutions of the equation
    are discussed in relation to the detuning diagram particular

    value of lies in a certain small range near forced oscillations
    with half the applied frequency are possible two of these have

    million dm. the building offers 6,835 sq.m. of space for
    320,000 items, with over 200 seats for readers, on an ideal
    site close to schools and the central bus station. the building
    is in 4 storeys linked by lifts, with the administrative
    department in a separate section. the ground floor contains
    issue and information counters, a link with the underground
    stack, fiction, children's and teenage libraries, catalogues,
    inter-library loan, photocopying and typing facilities; the 1st
    and 2nd floors house periodicals, special collections and

    <text>trends in modern bibliotherapy. gives an insight into
    author's own work carried out in cooperation with the
    psychiatric department of the district medical centre.
    psychiatric patients are given 1 hour per week of group
    reading, discussions, and writing short essays on selected
    literature in the presence of a librarian, a psychologist and a
    psychiatrist. bibliotherapy aims at breaking the silence
    barrier and helping self-expression. new trends are being
    introduced which take bibliotherapy from clinics into libraries
    for patients released from institutional care. schools of
    librarianship should take an interest, as specialised
    librarians are required for this work.</text>

    <text>research enhancement by heuristic information. after a
    review of heuristics and heuristic information some aspects of
    mission oriented information are dealt with from the
    librarian's viewpoint. information staff should be aware that
    relevant information may be located by searching fields other
    than the user's speciality. in addition to the traditional
    sources, an interdisciplinary approach assists in the
    exploitation of such materials as reports in methodological
    surveys, research reports and dissertations. sociological
    information can be of heuristic value in epidemiological
    research. however, heuristic information will be serviceable
    only if the librarian is familiar with the scientist's aims and
    field of research.</text>

    <text>an analysis of the differences between density-of-use
    ranking and raw use ranking of library journal use. reports of
    journal titles ranked by use with space and cost information
    included for each title can provide a means for making certain
    objective journal collection development decisions. each title
    can be assessed in relation to the others and the data for all
    titles can be cumulated so that decisions can be made at
    various cutoff points. simple ranking of titles by raw use
    (rur) may be inadequate and should be adjusted by some measure
    to allow for how much of the title is available to the user at
    the time of the collection of the use data. if the raw-use
    frequency of a title is divided by the actual linear shelf
    space of the title's file, a 'density-of-use' frequency is
    obtained. if these frequencies are then ranked, a
    'density-of-use rank' (dur) is formed. some differences between
    rur and dur have been analysed.</text>

    <text>everyman's information retrieval system the information

    a technical library with limited bubget and personnel. the
    solution, however, is quite general and is applicable to many
    different types of retrieval problems. further,the method of
    solution makes it possible for many groups who have previously
    dismissed an information retrieval program as expensive and
    difficult (from a programming stand-point) to reconsider their
    position, for the present solution makes it possible to install
    an information retrieval program in less than three months, and
    with relatively little equipment. march, 1963 whitley, v. w.

    are 250 of these with 1 1/2 million volumes serving 800,000
    employees. an investigation in 1974 by konjetzky and ploetz
    revealed an illiberal bias in book selection. the factory
    librarians' organisation justifies the library by its
    usefulness to the firm and refers to an article by muth (the
    reader as a factor of productivity in the firm), in which he
    argues that the aim of the library is to develop and maintain
    the ability to read, as efficient readers mean workers with
    high mobility, and money spent on libraries is likely to yield

    with a course held in finland, in oct 81. bibliometry is a
    mathematical aid for analysing library problems. unlike
    traditional library statistics, which use groups, bibliometry
    ranks individual units. it is a method based on simple
    logarithmic relations and is used to describe growth,
    obsolescence and spread. its usefulness is especially apparent
    in a time of cuts. gives an example which shows that
    bibliometric scales of the use of periodicals can be used to
    facilitate cuts, and another in which bibliometry has been used
    to analyse the attraction exercised by a few periodicals and
    their effect on publication of articles.</text>

    federal government's information and documentation programme
    has as its focal point the foundation of 16 centralised subject
    information centres between 1974 and 1977. this initial stage
    is not yet completed owing to lack of funds; only 3 centres are
    fully operational. the adequacy of these centres has been
    questioned, especially because of the emphasis on
    centralisation and the introduction of market economy
    principles; information stored might be selected mainly to suit
    industry. it is not yet known whether libraries must contribute
    towards costs, which will be expensive. trade unionists fear
    that the advanced technology in the centres will result in

    to accept this if they have not already opted for the academic
    library version but smaller public libraries stocking mainly
    german language material are critical of the draft. it was
    decided, therefore, that alternatives for small public
    libraries be included in rak-ob with reference to personal
    names, corporate bodies, unit subject headings, parallel
    headings, subordinate entries, entries for musicalia and sound
    recordings for children. rak-ob and rak-wb must not differ on

    research in the social sciences is a crucial factor in
    increasing understanding of and ultimately improving the
    practice of education. past tests of this assumption, however,
    have generally relied upon argument by example or anecdote. in
    this study, citation patterns in education literature are
    analysed to test the corollary proposition that basic research
    in the social sciences has had a substantial impact on
    education literature. empirical data collected on citation
    patterns in the education literature are found to be largely

    <text>the self-judgment method of curve fitting a
    computer-oriented method for processing and communicating
    numerical data is described. the instrument reliability factors
    (irf), which exactly define the limits of reliability of each
    measured item of information, are used to compute the maximum
    permitted error (mpe) associated with each values of each
    ordinate. the self-judgment principle (sjp) is used to discard
    wrong information and to compute mean values of the parameters
    and their mpe's in terms of the irf. data compatibility tests
    with any number of different equations can be made quickly.
    otherwise intractable problems are easily solved, and the
    design of many experiments is greatly simplified. the
    computational and mathematical techniques used to reduce bias
    in the sjp are discussed. inadequacies in the statistical and
    graphical methods of curve fitting are noted. august, 1965

    <text>numerical solution of nonlinear two-point boundary
    problems by finite difference methods solution of nonlinear
    two-point boundary-value problems is often an extremely
    difficult task. quite apart from questions of reality and
    uniqueness, there is no established numerical technique for
    this problem. at present, shooting techniques are the easiest
    method of attacking these problems. when these fail, the more
    difficult method of finite differences can often be used to
    obtain a solution. this paper gives examples and discusses the
    finite difference method for non-linear two-point
    boundary-value problems. june, 1964 holt, j. f. ca640618 jb

    of how 10 small, private college libraries go about collecting
    books focuses on the degree of responsibility and control those
    libraries exercise over what is included in their collections.
    the findings and conclusions of the study are based upon
    interviews with library administrators and acquisitions
    librarians at middlebury college, bowdoin, colby, bates,
    wellesley, amherst, trinity, hamilton, union, and colgate.
    these colleges were chosen because of thier similarities of
    purpose, staff size, student enrollment, faculty, number of
    library volumes added annually, library budgets, and library
    holdings. chapters identify the objectives of the study, the
    methodology used, findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

    <text>property and the constitution. delivery of depository
    copies to state libraries in reference to paragraph 14 of the
    basic law (grundgesetz). the controversial question as to
    whether publishers should be legally required to supply
    depository copies free of charge to libraries is once again
    being discussed in west germany. some publishers in
    baden-wurttemberg challenged this requirement and took their
    case before the federal constitutional court. an amended law
    was passed in baden-wurttemberg as a result of this action
    whereby publishers are still required to supply 1 copy free of
    charge but can be recompensed for up to 50% of their costs for
    any further copies. in the light of the constitution delivering
    depository copies is to be seen as a social duty directly
    linked to property ownership. the publisher has a duty to the
    public to supply libraries with current literature but a
    balance must be struck between this and the financial limits of
    the publisher.</text>

    <text>establishing a basis for mapping natural-language
    statements onto a database query language. describes a project

    mapping. a basis was developed for processing english-language
    requests for information retrieval from an existing dbms (data
    base management system). the role of each word in the
    natural-language query was identified by 2 separate methods-a
    learning algorithm and a statistical technique. the programme

    <text>an empirical study of list structure in lisp static
    measurements of the list structure of five large lisp programs
    are reported and analyzed in this paper. these measurements
    reveal substantial regularity, or predictability, among poin
    ters to atoms and especially among poin ters to lists. pointers
    to atoms are found to obey, roughly, zipf's law, which governs
    word frequencies in natural languages; poin ters to lists
    usually poin t to a location physically nearby in memory. the
    use of such regularities in the space-efficient representation
    of list structure is discussed. linearization of lists, whereby
    successive cdrs (or cars) are placed in consecutive memory
    locations whenever possible, greatly strengthens the observed
    regularity of list structure. it is shown that under some
    reasonable assumptions, the entropy or information content of a
    car-cdr pair in the programs measured is about 10 to 15 bits
    before linearization, and about 7 to 12 bits after. february,

    techniques for the automatic generation of invariants. the
    second part provides criteria for using the invariants to check
    simultaneously for correctness (including termination) or

    <text>multilevel operating systems the basic software for all
    newer computers is built on the well-established need for
    standard operating systems. this implies that all
    applications-no matter how large, complex or time
    consuming-must operate under (or, more precisely, on top of)
    the standard system. large applications require supervisory
    monitors which handle problems similar to those of the
    operating systems, but at a different level. sometimes, still a
    third or even a fourth such level is required or desirable.
    this leads naturally to the concept of multilevel
    systems-similar vertically, but different horizontally. proper
    division of responsibility between levels leads to greater
    efficiency and less logical complexity, while actually
    enhancing capability. march, 1966 orchard-hays, w. ca660310 jb

    <text>synchronization with eventcounts and sequencers
    synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling
    the relative ordering of events in the processes. a new
    synchronization mechanism is proposed, using abstract objects
    called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes to
    control the ordering of events directly, rather than using
    mutual exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables
    that control ordering of events. direct control of ordering
    seems to simplify correctness arguments and also simplifies
    implementation in distributed systems. the mechanism is defined
    formally, and then several examples of its use are given. the
    relationship of the mechanism to protection mechanisms in the
    system is explained; in particular, eventcounts are shown to be
    applicable to situations where confinement of information
    matters. an implementation of eventcount s and sequencers in a
    system with shared memory is described. february, 1979 reed,

    education for management has been carrying out a study on
    "curriculum development in management information systems
    education in colleges and universities" under a grant from the
    national science foundation. this position paper provides a
    framework for the study. preliminary conclusions are presented
    on the need for education in administrative information
    systems, and appropriate college curricula and courses are
    suggested. also, the role of professional societies and
    organizations using computers is discussed, and the plans of
    the committee are outlined. the initial approach of the

    determining a set of values of the ai which minimizes the sum
    of squares of differences between observed and calculated
    values of a distinguished observable, say zm. if the solution
    of the above equation for zm, zm=n(z1,...;a1,...) gives rise to
    a function n which is nonlinear in the ai, then one may rely on
    a version of gaussian regression [1,2] for an iteration scheme
    that converges to a minimizing set of values. it is shown here
    that this same minimization technique may be used for the
    solution of simultaneous (not necessarily linear) equations.

    <text>the removal and equipping of an industrial library. the

    collection of documents in 1963. by 1980 the library contained
    over 20,000 documents, annual loans totalled almost 10,000 and
    the collection had long outgrown the original library building.
    in 1975 plans had already been drawn up for a new library with
    a working area of 200 sq.m. together with a further 200 sq.m.
    of underground storage area for archival material. the public,
    staff and bookstack areas were planned to provide the most

    <text>shift-register code for indexing applications in this
    communication the use of a shift-register code with n = 10 is
    described for calling 64 wireless telemetering stations in a
    fixed cyclical order. a high degree of redundancy is used,
    permitting a single-error correcting code
    ("minimum-distance-three" code) with 64 10-bit code words to be
    employed as the station identification code. embedding this in
    the shift-register code with period 1023 permits the code to be
    employed without punctuation, each of the telemetering station
    receivers simply putting received ones and zeros into a shift
    register. each time the given code combination arises
    identifying the particular station (barring for tuitous error
    combinations of very low probability) it has been called. the

    local authorities are finding their cultural budgets, with
    libraries as the largest item, easy targets. attempts are made
    to save the book budget as far as possible and cuts are made
    instead in opening hours and activities. vacancies are likely
    to be frozen. for the library service the cuts mean that the
    stock of older titles will have to be reduced, but there are no
    plans to cut the number of titles offered. export of library
    furniture to the arab world alleviates somewhat the lack of

    <text>a comparative analysis of disk scheduling policies five
    well-known scheduling policies for movable head disks are
    compared using the performance criteria of expected seek time
    (system oriented)and expected waiting time (individual i/o
    request oriented). both analytical and simulation results are
    obtained. the variance of waiting time is introduced as another
    meaningful measure of performance, showing possible
    discrimination against individual requests. then the choice of
    a utility function to measure total performance including
    system oriented and individual request oriented measures is
    described. such a function allows one to differentiate among
    the scheduling policies over a wide range of input loading
    conditions. the selection and implementation of a maximum
    performance two-policy algorithm are discussed. march, 1972

    <text>the lrltran compiler extensive software problems confront

    and which frequently acquires new ones. to maintain cohesion, a
    system must be developed, written in a high level language,
    which minimizes machine dependencies and isolates those which
    are necessary. a language and a compiler for the language are
    discussed here. the language, called lrltran, is a heavily
    augmented fortran. the tree-pass compiler makes use internally
    of a postfix polish notation (pass i to pass ii) and a tree
    representation referred to as a "composite blocking table"
    (pass i to pass iii). machine-independent optimization occurs
    in pass ii and do-loop and machine-dependent optimization in

    <text>cairs-a computer assisted information retrieval system. a
    flexible low cost minicomputer based information retrieval
    system is described. cairs (computer assisted information
    retrieval system) allows information in the form of documents,
    text, records or abstracts to be stored in a computer data
    base. the programs have been written in rtl2, a high level
    transportable computer language, which allows cairs to run on
    most popular minicomputers. data entry is carried out using a
    direct key to disc facility, with formatted visual display
    screens being presented to speed input. the advantages of input
    validation and efficient editing of entered material are fully
    exploited, and an interactive thesaurus may also be used. data
    on cairs can be indexed using classification systems or
    hierarchical structures. alternatively, keyword indexing of the
    automatic, semi-automatic or manual type may be applied, plus
    either a free or controlled language vocabulary. searching
    proceeds via inverted file and ser ial (string) search
    functions, although a variety of specialised tasks allow
    bulletins, lists and catalogues to be produced. cairs is
    designed to replace any applications where manual card index
    filing systems are employed, and is available as both a
    software system or as a complete software/hardware
    package.</text>

    the population of manchester expanded rapidly in the years

    libraries. the necessary money was not available, so the city
    librarian suggested a travelling library on the lines of those
    already in use in the usa and the uk's 1st mobile library took
    to the streets of manchester in july 1931. the service was
    well-used and expanded, was suspended during world war ii, and
    was resumed in 1948. it is now an integral part of the city's
    library service, serving areas unable to support a branch
    library, those unable to visit a branch library, and areas
    where cuts in expenditure have forced branch library

    <text>information theory applied to the conversion of decision
    tables to computer programs using ideas from information
    theory, this paper develops a heuristic algorithm that converts
    a limited entry decision table to a tree structured computer
    program with near minimum average processing time. the method
    is applicable to any limited entry decision table and does not
    require that actions have single rules or that the cost of
    testing conditions be equal. it is thus more general than the
    previously published heuristic algorithms. compared to the
    optimal algorithm of reinwald and soland, this algorithm is
    easy to code and takes a much smaller translation time; it is
    thus felt that it is more useful in practice. the algorithm is
    well suited for manual conversion of decision tables to
    flowcharts. september, 1973 ganapathy, s. rajaraman, v.

    describes a model linguistic data bank (ldb) for a uk market,
    based on results from a continuing feasibility study at the
    university of manchester institute of science and technology. a
    ldb represents an economical and highly efficient way of
    organising the uk's efforts in the field of terminology, both
    with respect to english and the many foreign languages through
    which contact is maintained with non-english speaking
    countries. outlines the institutional and organisational
    structure and emphasises the services to be provided to various
    groups, and in particular to translators, and the important
    role these groups will play in assuring the continuing
    viability and relevance of the ldb, not only as users, but as
    contributors and advisors. considers data acquisition policy

    little hope of improving significantly the further education of
    librarians. there is a need for a more general syllabus, so
    that students emerge with detailed knowledge of a wide range of
    library activities. post-graduate students need to be more

    <text>variable length tree structures having minimum average
    search time sussenguth suggests in a paper (1963) that a file
    should be organized as a doubly-chained tree structure if it is
    necessary both to search and to update frequently. such a
    structure provides a compromise between the fast search/slow
    update characteristics of binary searching and the slow
    search/fast update characteristics of serial searching. his
    method, however, contains the limiting restriction that all
    terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree. this paper
    considers the effect of relaxing this restriction. first, trees
    which have the property that a priori the filial set of each
    node is well defined are studied. it is proved that coding the
    nodes within each filial set with respect to the number of
    terminal nodes reachable from each is necessary and sufficient
    to guarantee minimum average search time. then the more general
    case (that is, where the entire structure of the tree is
    changeable) is treated. a procedure is developed for
    constructing a tree with a minimum average search time. a
    simple closed expression for this minimum average search time
    is obtained as a function of the number of terminal nodes. the
    storage capacity required to implement the doubly-chained tree
    structure on a digital computer is also determined. finally,
    the total cost of the structure, using sussenguth's cost
    criterion, is computed. it is shown that significant
    improvements in both the average search time and the total cost
    can be obtained by relaxing sussenguth's restriction that all
    terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree. february,

    its functions and user groups were handed to the architects,
    who worked out a proposal on the basis of these. the library
    shares the building with the local council's cultural and
    educational committees, the resources and av centres. describes
    the layout of the library. the large information desk is
    centrally placed. close to this are the periodicals and
    exhibition areas, catalogues and reference works. on one side
    of a passage lies the book hall with 60,000 volumes of fiction
    and non-fiction and 70 seats; on the other lie specialised
    departments. in the basement are study carrels and stacks with
    200,000 volumes. in all, an open and well arranged library. the
    architect, hugo hoije describes how the aims of flexibility and
    openness are met by a construction without supporting walls.
    the angular shaped exterio r follows the traditional inner city
    plan and creates a yard for service vehicles. ants viirman
    describes the preparations for the move to the new library,
    which included a total survey of the media stock and some

    <text>computing capabilities at argentine and chilean
    universities the author reports on a trip to universities in
    argentina and chile during november 1968, describing university
    conditions and computing activities. as elsewhere, these
    universities are experiencing student discontent with the
    status quo and the solutions they are attempting contrast:
    argentina is excluding students from participating in
    university government; chile is allowing such participation.
    university computing service and academic activities are
    limited. the number of computers is small and so is the
    capacity, none larger than an ibm 360/40; with some exception,
    computing science academic programs are rare. this situation is
    by no means attributable to those responsible for computing
    developments, who strive for excellence; rather the "system" is
    hard to over-come. universities, especially those with strong
    european traditions, adapt slowly to new academic resources and
    disciplines; superimposed are the severe technological and
    economic constraints of the developing nation. consequently, in
    the absence of conscious government emphasis on strengthening
    computing capabilities, future progress may be retarded.

    <text>data filtering applied to information storage and
    retrieval applications manipulation of data strings is the most
    complex processing function in information storage and
    retrieval applications. data string manipulation is discussed
    within the context of an interpretive processing environment
    controlled by the use of procedural directives. the sequence of
    procedural directives is derived from a job assumed to be
    expressed in a user-oriented source language. each data string
    with the structured data environment (data bank) is explicitly
    or implicitly related to a format declaration residing in a
    format library. the processing mechanics associated with data
    string manipulation is developed in accordance with a
    generalized data filtering concept. this results in the
    implementation of a two-part data filter module that satisfies
    internal processing functions by filtering data strings through
    format declarations associated with its input and output ports.

    the working group is designing a computerised cataloguing
    system for public libraries. just over 70% of the respondents
    use finnish cataloguing rules. just under 50% of the
    respondents use their own subject indexing and nearly 87% of
    the respondents use the 1975 edition of the finnish
    classification scheme based on dewey. over 50% use the

    <text>an optimal method for deletion in one-sided
    height-balanced trees a one-sided height-balanced tree is a
    binary tree in which every node's right subtree has a height
    which is equal to or exactly one greater than the height of its
    left subtree. it has an advantage over the more general avl
    tree in that only one bit of balancing information is required
    (two bits are required for the acl tree). it is shown that
    deletion of an arbitrary node of such a tree can be
    accomplished in o(logn) operations, where n is the number of
    nodes in the tree. moreover the method is optimal in the sense
    that its complexity cannot be reduced in order of magnitude.
    this result, coupled with earlier results by hirschberg,
    indicates that, of the three basic problems of insertion,
    deletion, and retrieval, only insertion is adversely affected
    by this modification of an avl tree. june, 1978 zweben, s.h.

    displacement of records from their calculated address, which is
    one less than the number of probes required to address a

    <text>online literature research at university libraries in the

    was to coordinate and improve activities in the information and
    documentation sector which had developed rapidly in recent
    years. the programme concentrated on setting up 4 subject
    oriented data systems' patents, research procedure, environment
    and technological rules. the progress in each area has been
    different. 17 libraries received an on-line connection to the
    dimdi (deutsche insitut fur medizinische dokumentation und
    information) data bank in cologne in the framework of a project
    organised by the ministry for research and technology.
    libraries also had on-line connections to data banks formed by
    the information centre for energy, physics and mathematics. the
    question of finance is the largest obstacle to university
    libraries providing permanent o n-line facilities for
    literature research. although some on-line data services are
    available to libraries free of charge the cost of the hardware
    has to be covered by the libraries.</text>

    <text>county libraries' regional service-problems and lines of
    development. the norwegian library system is currently in a
    phase of stagnation, partly due to economic factors, but also
    because of uncertainties in several areas. discussion continues
    on the introduction of computerisation, and a rationalisation
    programme, now over 10 years old, is attempting to apportion
    functions and financial responsibility between government and
    local authorities. county libraries, with their triple task of
    advisory service, inter-library lending, and mobile library
    service, are particularly vulnerable. these services, which
    benefit public libraries, school libraries and individual
    readers, could be adversely affected by some rationalisation
    proposals. the first 2 could be maintained and improved if
    county libraries were made national institutions attached to
    large municipal libraries. mobile services are poorly developed
    in norway, partly because not all areas are geographically
    suitable. a restructuring of th e country's library system is
    urgently needed, and county librarians must evaluate their own
    position and services.</text>

    recent methods due to butcher and gear are compared with

    <text>an interactive software system for computers-aided
    design: an application to circuit project the characteristics
    of an interactive software system, intended to constitute an
    interface between designer and computer during various steps of
    the design process, are presented. the main emphasis is given
    to the description of the features of the two high level user
    oriented languages, operating at different levels, on which the
    interaction is based. the first one is imol, an interactive
    monitor language, which is designed to perform the overall and
    control functions of the software system; its design criteria
    provide the user with commands which are both simple and
    efficient in order to perform all the functions needed in
    computer-aided circuit design. the second one is coif, a
    circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed to
    describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem
    specifications; it is an extension of fortran with graphic-type
    variables, so that the designer who is familiar with fortran
    need not learn a new language. the application to
    computer-aided circuit design is in particular examined; on the
    other hand, the adopted design criteria provide sufficient
    generality to extend the use of the two languages to different
    computer-assisted applications. september, 1970 bracchi, g.

    <text>the origin of the ionospheric irregularities responsible

    component of the electric potential field produced is
    communicated to the f region as suggested by martyn where
    magneto electric forces then cause the ionization to form
    eddies it is suggested that the absence of daytime
    scintillations is due to the inhibition of turbulent flow by
    large temperature gradients during the day the theory is then
    shown to explain the major features of radio star

    statistical analysis indicates that the influence of pressure
    on the nocturnal variation of electron concentration is
    unexpectedly small while that of temperature is large analysis
    of the monthly mean values indicates that attachment rather
    than recombination is the mechanism responsible for the

    not large is significant further evidence in favour of the
    attachment theory is obtained from consideration of

    cdr, rplaca, replacd, eq, and atom in lisp) is bounded by a
    (small) constant. classical implementations of list processing
    systems lack this property because allocating a list cell from
    the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process requires
    time proportional to the heap size to finish. a real-time list
    processing system is presented which continuously reclaims
    garbage, including directed cycles, while linearizing and
    compacting the accessible cells into contiguous locations to
    avoid fragmenting the free storage pool. the program is small
    and requires no time-sharing interrupts, making it suitable for
    microcode. finally, the system requires the same average time,
    and not more than twice the space, of a classical
    implementation, and those space requirements can be reduced to
    approximately classical proportions by compact list
    representation. arrays of different sizes, a program stack, and
    hash linking are simple extensions to our system, and reference
    counting is found to be inferior for many applications. april,

    <text>the expansion of the rural library service in bavaria
    within the framework of the general development of bavarian
    libraries. lecture given at the 29th conference of state
    library centres in west germany, burghausen, sept 81. basic
    provision of stocks and staff is still not as good in rural as
    in urban areas; further financial provision from the state is
    necessary if library services are to be improved. plans for
    improving bavarian libraries are linked closely with national
    development schemes. every village with over 3,000 inhabitants
    has a branch library and smaller villages are served by mobile
    libraries, more of which are still needed. closure of many
    small branch libraries has resulted in a concentration of
    services and in increased stocks and readership. cooperation
    between public and school libraries and between local authority

    graphs, the problem of ascertaining whether or not they are

    is known. since a straightforward enumerative algorithm might
    require 40 years of running time on a very high speed computer
    in order to compare two 15-node graphs, a more sophisticated
    approach seems called for. the situation is similar to that
    prevailing in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving,
    where practical algorithms are unknown (for the interesting
    cases), but where various practical though only partially
    successful techniques are available. git-graph isomorphism
    tester-incorporates a variety of processes that attempt to
    narrow down the search for an isomorphism, or to demonstrate
    that none exists. no one scheme is relied upon exclusively for
    a solution, and the program is designed to avoid excessive
    computation along fruitless lines. git has been written in the
    comit language and successfully tested on the ibm 7090.

    mathematics indicate that it should be possible to
    algorithmically generate many properties of solutions to
    differential equations. such a theory is preferable to a less

    <text>on the external storage fragmentation produced by
    first-fit and best-fit allocation strategies published
    comparisons of the external fragmentation produced by first-fit
    and best-fit memory allocation have not been consistent.
    through simulation, a series of experiments were performed in
    order to obtain better data on the relative performance of
    first-fit and best-fit and a better understanding of the
    reasons underlying observed differences. the
    time-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and best-fit were
    generally within 1 to 3 percent of each other. except for small
    populations, the size of the request population had little
    effect on allocation efficiency. for exponential and
    hyperexponential distributions of requests, first-fit
    outperformed best-fit; but for normal and uniform
    distributions, and for exponential distributions distorted in
    various ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit. it is
    hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit, it does
    so because first-fit, by preferentially allocating toward one
    end of memory, encourages large blocks to grow at the other
    end. sufficient contiguous space is thereby more likely to be
    available for relatively large requests. results of simulation
    experiments supported this hypothesis and showed that the
    relative performance of first-fit and best-fit depends on the
    frequency of request. when the coefficient of variation of the
    request distribution is greater than or approximately equal to
    unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit. august, 1975 shore, j.

    <text>serials control. paper presented at the aslib conference
    information '81' forecasts and realities, oxford university,
    uk, 22-25 sept 81. serials control is throught to be the most
    difficult of library housekeeping processes to automate. no
    automated serials control system has yet been demonstrated to
    be cost-effective. minicomputer based systems show promise of
    more efficient operation. studies at oxford university have
    shown the feasibility of automated serials check-in being
    achieved faster than is possible manually. further studies have
    demonstrated the constraints imposed for a comprehensive system
    to be cost-effective. prediction of the arrival date for
    irregular serials is a major problem. the difficulties (and
    expense) of updating files in real-time represents another
    problem for which a tentative solution is proposed. the need to
    improve the user interface is emphasised and this is one of the
    most important matters for further study.</text>

    <text>improving the system of methodological guidance.

    today it has reached a higher level of efficiency in acting
    through the centralised library networks set up throughout the
    ussr. the ways in which the library serving as the guidance
    centre within a network can influence the work of its dependent

    the need to envision and architecture data base systems in a

    data base (file) organization is then analyzed, considering
    implementation oriented aspects. the inverted directory is
    viewed realistically as another large data base which itself is
    subjected to inversion. formulations are derived to estimate
    average access time (read only) and storage requirements,
    formalizing the interaction of data base content
    characteristics, logical complexity of queries, and machine
    timing and blocking specifications identified as having a
    first-order effect on performance. the formulations presented

    <text>effects of solar flares on the absorption of cosmic noise
    abnormal variations of ionospheric absorption were investigated
    during the course of the observations reported previously of
    most cases of unusually high absorption appear to be associated
    with solar flares observations of the increases in absorption
    during the resulting sudden ionospheric disturbances are
    compared with observations of sudden phase anomalies in waves
    rn waves reflected from the ionosphere a db absorption
    difference appears to correspond to a phase anomaly of about at
    the frequency considered as a method of detecting sudden
    ionospheric disturbances observation of the absorption
    variation variation is as sensitive as and more convenient than
    observation of phase anomalies evidence was found of a delayed
    increase of absorption about hours after some solar flares the
    magnetic records sshowed no abnormal features at these times
    and it is uncertain whether the excess absorption occurs within
    the ionosphere or outside it</text>

    <text>arguments for a moratorium on the construction of a
    community information utility in this article the author urges
    a prudent and decentralized approach to the question of the
    design and desirability of computerized community information
    utilities. before accepting the inevitability and desirability
    of this or any technology, we should: (1) be sure of the
    feasibility (internally and externally) of what is proposed;
    (2) project and perhaps wait for changes in complementary
    techniques; (3) evaluate current and projected supplementary
    techniques; (4) establish the existence of demand for what is
    proposed; (5) take steps to involve a representative group of
    ultimate users in systems design, and (6) carefully think
    through possible side effects on man and his world view.
    current proposals for community information utilities are
    examined in this framework, and the conclusion is drawn that
    society is not yet in a position to justify either the
    construction of an information utility in a prototype community
    or the acceptance of a policy in favor of its widespread
    implementation. december, 1974 press, l. i. community

    <text>library literacy: who? when? where?. the problem of
    inadequate library education in primary and secondary schools
    has far-reaching results. academic librarians must teach
    students the basics of library use before embarking on
    course-related instruction-all in a very short time and with
    reduced success. school leavers who go directly into the work
    force-the very people who most need and could best profit from
    libraries-will never have effective library access. this makes
    the lives of many poorer and more difficult; denies them some
    measure of satisfaction, success, and happiness; and erodes
    society's ability to deal with critical problems and govern
    itself. children must learn reading, writing, arithmetic, and
    library use together.</text>

    <text>deichman library and series books for children. in spring
    79 deichman library, oslo, stopped buying children's series
    books and discarded worn-out stock copies. they were surprised
    by hostile public reaction (a selection of readers' letters to
    oslo newspapers is appended), having regarded the move as
    correcting a long-standing mistake. since the mid-60s deichman
    had bought a few copies of 2hardy boys1 and similar titles,
    recognised as sub-standard literature, but intended to lead
    children to better books and increase the then inadequate
    selection of children's literature. by 1979 the standard of
    norwegian children's literature had greatly improved and the
    number of available titles increased. in view of rising book
    prices, priority was given to good norwegian children's books
    rather than adult and foreign books in children's departments
    (excepting books for immigrants). series books were excluded
    for a year as an experiment.</text>

    establishments (a.d.a.c.e.s.). library and documentation
    centres were established in 6 elementary schools, and a number

    read, sources of material, and borrowing from the centres; (2)
    how the centres function: formal and informal cultural

    librarian, and his relations with teachers and children; and
    (3) the influence of the centres on teaching practices:
    teachers' attitudes, and differences between schools in

    possessed university degrees, few of them possessed
    qualifications in librarianship. in public libraries, by
    contrast, most senior staff have librarianship qualifications.
    the new situation has been caused by legal changes, the final
    results of which cannot be predicted with certainty. at present
    there is a wide variety of courses available; the best balance
    of theoretical and practical training must be chosen. further
    consideration must be given to the joint training of librarians

    <text>symbolic execution and program testing this paper
    describes the symbolic execution of programs. instead of
    supplying the normal inputs to a program (e.g. numbers) one
    supplies symbols representing arbitrary values. the execution
    proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be
    symbolic formulas over the input symbols. the difficult, yet
    interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution of
    conditional branch type statements. a particular system called
    effigy which provides symbolic execution for program testing
    and debugging is also described. it interpretively executes
    programs written in a simple pl/i style programming language.
    it includes many standard debugging features, the ability to
    manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions, a simple
    program testing manager, and a program verifier. a brief
    discussion of the relationship between symbolic execution and
    program proving is also included. july, 1976 king, j. c.

    union library visits and others. numerical results of the
    survey are broken down and related to the socio-economic

    <text>a method for composing simple traditional music by
    computer a method is described for composing musical rounds by
    computer. this method uses some music theory plus additional
    heuristics. fundamental to the method is a set of productions
    together with sets of applicability rules and weight rules
    which operate on the productions deciding when and to what
    extent they are available for use. several rounds generated by
    the computer implementation of the method are presented.
    generally, the resultant music sounds mediocre to the
    professional although usually pleasing to the layman. it
    appears that full-blown music theory is not needed for
    rounds--all the hardware required for structural levels is not
    necessary for these pieces. the author has tried to address
    both musicians and computer scientists. november, 1974 rader,

    <text>a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser
    computers the ability of a computer system to communicate with
    the outside world efficiently is as important as its ability to
    perform computations efficiently. it is quite difficult to
    characterize a particular user, but rather easy to characterize
    the entire user community. based on the properties of this
    community we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
    no claim is made that a virtual console behaves like any actual
    console, but the entire collection of virtual consoles models
    the collection of actual consoles. using the model we answer
    questions like: how many processes are suspended waiting for
    console input? what is the maximum rate at which a process can
    execute? what bounds can be set on overall buffer requirements?
    answers to these and similar questions are needed in certain
    aspects of operating system design. september, 1968 denning, p.

    <text>a method for overlapping and erasure of lists an
    important property of the newell-shaw-simon scheme for computer
    storage of lists is that data having multiple occurrences need
    not be stored at more than one place in the computer. that is,
    lists may be "overlapped." unfortunately, overlapping poses a
    problem for subsequent erasure. given a list that is no longer
    needed, it is desired to erase just those parts that do not
    overlap other lists. in lisp, mccarthy employs an elegant but
    inefficient solution to the problem. the present paper
    describes a general method which enables efficient erasure. the
    method employs interspersed reference counts to describe the
    extent of the overlapping. december, 1960 collins, g. e.

    reduction in computation and storage which can be achieved when
    the series is real. also discussed are hardware and software

    systems are substituted for these terminals. using numeric
    representations of entire words or common phrases (rather than
    character-by-character representations) requires approximately
    one-third of present transmission time. this saving is
    reflected in overall costs. other benefits accrue in code and

    recordings in various forms, maps, posters and individual
    cubicles for listening to sound recordings. today the most
    important aspect of av aids in libraries is not the
    introduction of every available new av development into the
    academic library but the development of a media section in the
    library with special emphasis on particular departments within
    the library e.g. the music department. new developments such as
    viewdata, video, cable television and computer learning aids
    cannot be automatically integrated into libraries. various
    factors must be taken into consideration when selecting a new
    av aid for a library; the information value, economic aspects,
    and the amount of additional staff training which will be
    necessary to make full use of the aids.</text>

    <text>relaxation methods for image reconstruction the problem
    of recovering an image (a function of two variables) from
    experimentally available integrals of its grayness over thin
    strips is of great importance in a large number of scientific
    areas. an important version of the problem in medicine is that
    of obtaining the exact density distribution within the human
    body from x-ray projections.one approach that has been taken to
    solve this problem consists of translating the available
    information into a system of linear inequalities. the size and
    the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000
    inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the coefficients
    nonzero) makes methods using successive relaxations
    computationally attractive, as compared to other ways of
    solving systems of inequalities. in this paper, it is shown
    that, for a consistent system of linear inequalities, any
    sequence of relaxarion parameters lying strictly between 0 and
    2 generates a sequence of vectors which converges to a
    solution. under the same assumptions, for a system of linear
    equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum norm
    solution. previously proposed techniques are shown to be
    special cases of our procedure with different choices of
    relaxation parameters. the practical consequences for image
    reconstruction of the choice of the relaxation parameters are
    discussed. february, 1978 herman, g.t. lent, a. lutz, p.h.

    begins to become a tool for decision making, strategic planning

    <text>the non-departmental library. describes an experiment
    with a department common to adults and children in the new
    library in emmaboda, opened in autumn 80. the shape of the new
    library made it difficult to divide it into departments and the
    possibility of savings in acquisition of material suitable for
    both adults and children, or for young people on the borderline
    of adulthood persuaded the library to try to integrate the
    material. the library is divided into fiction and non-fiction,
    with non-fiction books for children placed after those for
    adults on the same shelf; adult fiction and children's fiction
    have their own shelves, but in the same place in the hall. an
    area in connection with the issue desk contains periodicals and
    picture books with seating for all ages, including headphones
    for children. after a year the experience has proved entirely

    <text>optimal reorganization of distributed space disk files in
    most database organizations, the cost of accessing the database
    will increase due to structural changes caused by updates and
    insertions. by reorganizing the database,the access costs can
    be reduced. a basic problem is to establish the proper tradeoff
    between performance, storage costs, and reorganization costs.
    this paper considers the optimum points at which to reorganize
    a database. a disk file organization which allows for
    distributed free space is described. a cost function describing
    the excess costs due to physical disorganization is defined,
    and this function is minimized to obtain the optimum
    reorganization points. numerical examples based on the
    characteristics of existing disk storage devices are given.

    <text>new era of the school of librarianship in bratislava. the

    simultaneously with similar schools in prague and brno. after
    overcoming considerable difficulties of various kinds in the
    1st 10 years of its history, the school has concentrated in
    educating and training prospective non-graduate librarians and
    information scientists. so far about 3,000 students have
    completed their full-time or part-time courses. almost 90% of
    them work in libraries and in centres of scientific, technical
    and economic information. commencing in the academic year
    1984-85, new syllabuses will come into force. the courses
    offered will be full-time only. after 2 years with a common
    curriculum, students will take up either librarianship or
    information science for the remaining 2 years, when final
    examinations of a theoretical and practical nature will be
    held. the new project, worked out under the auspices of the
    research institute for vocational education and training in
    prague, will become a further step towards providing libraries

    of technology and economics on the publishing and influence of
    scholarly journals and their role as a communications medium.
    areas covered include the functions of the primary journal,
    economic pressures, and the availability of new technologies
    such as computers, synoptic journals, microforms, word
    processing equipment, electronic journals, and the digitised
    transmission of information. implications of these innovations

    <text>the indian council of library and information services
    research and training: a proposal for consideration. critically
    examines the indian library scene. the management, operation,
    and services of most libraries is inefficient and ineffective,
    resulting in grave misallocation and underutilisation of
    library resources. little major research has been carried out.
    university librarianship courses are not much help for managing
    and operating libraries efficiently. the major national
    institutions have serious limitations. to improve the
    situation, proposes the establishment of an indian council of
    library and information services research and training. the
    council would be set up by the government and have well-defined
    roles and functions covering all aspects of indian

    <text>guidance of individual reading as a worthwhile activity.
    in a time when librarians have to work with large numbers of
    readers with demands of ever-increasing complexity, it is
    important to organise precisely the work of individual reading
    guidance. the process by which a reader selects a book can be
    broken down into various stages and decisions, and the
    librarian can exert a positive influence throughout the
    process. if the aims and stages of the librarian's guidance are
    planned schematically beforehand, it is possible to record each
    reader's progress and reactions in a concise coded system which
    is suitable for most public library situations.</text>

    <text>regional collaboration in the swedish library system.
    contribution to an issue devoted to public library services in
    sweden. sweden's public libraries are basically operated by the
    local authorities. the state can provide grants to level out
    standards but does not interfere in the running of local
    libraries, and sweden has no libraries act. municipal
    authorities themselves decide the objectives, scale and
    structure of their library services. all of sweden's 279
    municipalities provide municipal library services. certain
    library functions would be too expensive to operate on a purely
    municipal basis-it is therefore rational and efficient to
    transfer these to the regional or supramunicipal-that is,
    county-level.</text>

    <text>experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose
    heuristic program an automatic learning capability has been
    developed and implemented for use with the multiple
    (multipurpose program that learns) heuristic tree-searching
    program, which is presently being applied to resolution
    theorem-proving in predicate calculus. multiple's proving
    program (pp) uses two evaluation functions to guide its search
    for a proof of whether or not a particular goal is achievable.
    thirteen general features of predicate calculus clauses were
    created for use in the automatic learning of better evaluation
    functions for pp. a multiple regression program was used to
    produce optimal coefficients for linear polynomial functions in
    terms of the features. also, automatic data-handling routines
    were written for passing data between the learning program and
    the proving program, and for analyzing and summarizing results.
    data was generally collected for learning (regression analysis)
    from the experience of pp. a number of experiments were
    performed to test the effectiveness and generality of the
    learning program. results showed that the learning produced
    dramatic improvements in the solutions to problems which were
    in the same domain as those used for collection learning data.
    learning was also shown to generalize successfully to domains
    other than those used for data collection. another experiment
    demonstrated that the learning program could simultaneously
    improve performance on problems in a specific domain and on
    problems in a variety of domains. some variations of the
    learning program were also tested. february, 1971 slagle, j. r.

    treated with apathy and resistance due to the philosophy of
    placing priorities on services. concludes that restoration work
    is best left to professional conservators while preventative

    on a number of national committees. in 1962 mrs. vintges was
    appointed general consultant with the centrale vereniging voor

    education and social welfare should no longer be regarded as
    purely the responsibility of local authorities.</text>

    error is used as the measure of goodness of fit, optimal
    results are not obtained when the initial approximation is a
    best fit. it is shown here that if, instead, the so-called
    logarithmic error is used, then a best initial fit is optimal
    for both types of error. moreover, use of the logarithmic error
    appears to simplify the problem of determining the optimal

    but assisted and guided even more than before by expert
    advisers, working in particular at the methodological centres
    of regional central libraries. their work must be adapted to
    the new, much more complicated requirements of the 1980s and be

    <text>optimal his togram matching by monotone gray level
    transformation this paper investigates the problem of optimal
    his togram matching using monotone gray level transformation,
    which always assigns all picture points of a given gray level i
    to another gray level t(i) such that if i &gt; j, then t(i)
    &gt; t(j). the objective is to find a transformed digital
    picture of a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors
    between the gray level his togram of the transformed picture
    and that of a reference picture is minimized. this is
    equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered objects of different
    sized one by one into k2 linearly ordered boxes of assorted
    sizes, such that the accumulated error of space under packed or
    overpacked in the boxes is minimized; the placement function is
    monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution to this
    problem. a tree search algorithm for optimal his togram
    matching is presented which has time complexity o(k1 x k2). if
    the monotone property is dropped, then the problem becomes
    np-complete, even if it is restricted to k2 = 2. october, 1978

    summary of a 1977 brazilian thesis in information science.
    presents a model for information centres in research
    institutes, to identify potential clients and promote the

    information services are defined, and 14 different kinds of
    research institutes relevant to this model listed. the proposed
    model demonstrates how to establish the characteristics of both
    internal and external users; the nature of the information
    needs of researchers, technicians, and marketers; and the
    information services to be offered, with particular reference
    to abstracting and question and answer services. by effecting
    continuous interaction between the institute and its clients
    such information services allow identification of the nature of
    potential demands for information, technical services, and

    <text>a survey of business managers and library directors to
    identify the variables affecting the final decision on library
    budgets in institutions awarding at least the baccalaureate,
    but less than the doctorate degree. (phd thesis-florida state
    university.) 75 institutions, 5.3% were randomly selected from
    a 1,412 population and surveyed in mar 78. a total of 125
    (83.3%) questionnaires were returned from 150 mailed to
    business managers and library directors of sample institutions.
    a questionnaire was returned by either the business manager,
    library director or both from 73 of the 75 sample institutions
    giving an institutional response of 97.3%. 49 budgeting
    variables were identified by library directors and 45 by
    business managers with 38 common variables. by combining the
    weighted percentage of each variable, the overall top 10
    budgeting variables were found. a survey of the literature on
    librarianship and higher education, an analysis of the
    literature variables and those identified by th e sample

    a library lesson that is not attached to a particular subject
