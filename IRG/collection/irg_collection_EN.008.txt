    <text>initial experience with an operating multiprogramming
    system the lewis research center has been using various forms
    and degrees of program simultaneity in the operation of its
    modified sperry-rand univac scientific model 1103 computer
    during the last five years. this simultaneity has evolved from
    an initial achievement of self-searching input and output to
    the automatic time sharing of independently coded problems.
    several important machine and program system modifications were
    necessary to accomplish this evolution. several additional
    modifications, although not required, were added to facilitate
    ease of coding and operation. all modifications had to proceed
    at a relatively temperate pace to insure that the basic
    data-reduction work load of the computing center was completed
    on schedule. some educationally valuable mistakes were made,
    and their suggested cures often pointed the way to useful
    future improvements or emphasized some of the basic principles
    of a multiprogramming system. the material that follows is a
    description of the evolution of the programming and hardware
    system which has developed into the present multiprogramming
    system at lewis research center. may, 1962 landis, n. manos, a.

    <text>deadlock avoidance in store-and-forward networks.
    store-and-forward network deadlocks may be avoided by
    forwarding messages from buffer to buffer in accordance with a
    loop-free directed buffer graph which accommodates all the
    desired message routes. use of guaranteed paths in the buffer
    graph and optional path switching are described, along with
    message reclassification to free members of the common buffer
    pool. an efficient buffer-counting procedure in each node
    handles messages requiring several buffers, increases
    flexibility of buffer usage, minimises overheads during message
    reclassification or path switching, and simplifies jumping
    between normal low-overhead operation when deadlock is far and
    more careful operation when deadlock is near.</text>

    <text>a fast algorithm for copying list structures an algorithm
    is presented for copying an arbitrarily linked list structure
    into a block of contiguous storage locations without destroying
    the original list. apart from a fixed number of program
    variables, no auxiliary storage, such as a stack, is used. the
    algorithm needs no mark bits and operates in linear time. it is
    shown to be significantly faster than fisher's algorithm, the
    fastest previous linear-time algorithm for the same problem.
    its speed comes mainly from its efficient list-traversal
    technique, which folds the processing stack into the structure
    being built, and from its classification of list cells into
    nine types, which enables processing operations to be optimized
    for each type. may, 1978 clark, d.w. list copying, lisp, space

    <text>coding clinical laboratory data for automatic storage and
    retrieval a series of clinical laboratory codes have been
    developed to accept and store urin analysis, blood chemistry,
    and hematology test results for automatic data processing. the
    codes, although constructed as part of a computerized hospital
    simulation, have been able to handle the results of every
    laboratory test that they have encountered. the unique feature
    of these codes is that they can accept conventionally recorded
    qualitative as well as quantitative test results. consequently,
    clinical test results need not be arbitrarily stratified,
    standardized, or altered in any way to be coded. this paper
    describes how the codes were developed and presents a listing
    of the urin analysis codes. five criteria used in developing
    the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous
    terminology is discussed. a solution to the problem is
    described. flexible, computer-produced, composite laboratory
    reports are also discussed, along with reproduction of such a
    report. the paper concludes that even though many problems
    remain unsolved, the next ten years could witness the emergence
    of a practical automated information system in the laboratory.

    at present no extensive body of knowledge exists concerning the
    effects which these variable lags can cause. shown here is a
    method of reducing some differential-difference equations to

    <text>the allocation of computer resources-is pricing the
    answer? the widespread use of complex third generation
    computing systems has led to a much broader concern about the
    means by which the resources of these systems are allocated
    among the user community. one means that is suggested more and
    more frequently is a pricing procedure. in this paper the
    manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources
    is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism
    fits this mold is discussed. inasmuch as pricing must serve as
    a rationing mechanism at times, consideration is given to the
    means by which prices can be adjusted flexibly in order to make
    a dynamic allocation of resources. consideration is also given
    to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful
    effects of frequent price fluctuations. although the subject of
    pricing has been given a lot of attention recently, a number of
    misconceptions persist about its purpose and its operation. an
    attempt is made to clarify some of these misunderstandings and
    to highlight the advantages and disadvantages and to highlight
    the advantages and disadvantages of pricing. two illustrative
    pricing systems are also discussed in order to demonstrate the
    applicability of pricing in quite different environments.

    <text>the true facts about censorship?. reply to an article by

    333-337 (for an abstract of which 2see1 82/4167), in which
    attention was drawn to the hidden censorship practised by
    public libraries. groeskamp's definition of censorship should
    more properly be termed 'rejection on ethical grounds'. because
    of lack of space and financial resources, libraries cannot
    purchase all books published and selection is necessary to
    obtain a balanced collection of material. the facts on which
    groeskamp's arguments are based include 2 library surveys, of
    which 1 contained insufficient data to draw any firm
    conclusions, while the other produced results in conflict with
    groeskamp's deductions. for financial reasons it is to be
    expected that in a community of 1 religious persuasion few
    books of a different persuasion are likely to be found in the

    <text>computers in public libraries. a norwegian county

    automation' (1) library technology and administrative routines;
    (2) indexing, storage and retrieval of information. norwegian
    public libraries should probably begin with administrative
    routines and proceed gradually, while discussing major
    long-term objectives, such as' an integrated system; a
    decentralised system utilising central services; libraries not
    using computers themselves, but largely dependent on
    computerised productions. the library centre will eventually
    act as a data base for public library literature and a centre
    for public library computer operations. local systems are
    viable only for the largest libraries; small and medium-sized
    libraries must be linked to a central authority, and hence to
    the resources of the large libraries. public libraries must
    formulate their own policy for automation, evaluating systems
    accordingly.</text>

    regarded as an opportunity rather than as an unwelcome
    necessity. "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
    and improvement of computer output, is exemplified by the use
    of a concordance in preparing a survey article or lecture.
    other opportunities for heavy editing are described, chief
    among them being interpretation and expansion of computer
    output in such processes as factor analysis. applications are

    with optional listings, decks and debugging information. using
    the chain feature of ibsys, links written in map or fortran as

    <text>biblio-data' the data bank at the german national

    literature data bank for on-line searching in west germany. by
    dec 81 it was linked to 66 institutions in germany and other
    european countries and had access via the stairs retrieval
    system to euronet diane. over 900,000 documentary units are
    available and 100,000 are added annually. the data bank aims to
    include references to all new german monographs and
    periodicals, although not to periodical articles, and retrieval
    is possible via all important data elements. in service quality
    and quantity biblio-data is ahead of most printed

    procedures. 2nd, the new data collection system could provide a
    tool for assessing the current state of readiness of
    operational units throughout the navy. 3rd, this system could
    be used as a basis for making predictions concerning staffing
    and material requirements of any medical facility under a
    variety of conditions. finally, the proposed outpatient system
    could be tied to the current inpatient system to derive
    complete medical histories for individual patients. by merging
    the 2 data systems a research tool would be created that could
    provide investigators with an unprecedented opportunity to

    challenge of other media. surveys the history of the press in
    general since the invention of printing, and shows that today
    the public prefers press reportage of important events to radio
    and television coverage. since the war, technological
    developments have increased the efficiency of the press as well
    as promoting rival media. despite social changes and improved
    living standards, radio and television have not replaced the
    press, but rather supplement it. the effects of local radio and
    national information networks remain to be seen, but unlike
    radio and television, the press is not state controlled. the
    public has always looked to the press for comment and news in
    eventful times, and will probably continue to do so.</text>

    <text>an approach to the clients and uses of selective
    dissemination of information (sdi) systems' the organizational
    setting of subscribers to an information retrieval service.
    (phd thesis-syracuse university.) examines the user of sdi
    systems. the data thus obtained do not support the current
    model relating to the identifying of users and uses of sdi
    services, and expose the model and its theoretical framework as
    being too narrow, excluding several segments of the user
    community. develops an alternative model based on mass
    communication theory and incorporating scientific communication
    theory. the new model identifies the clients of sdi services as
    a cluster of social actors, each performing some task in
    obtaining and using sdi services.</text>

    the educational impact of the workshops on the university's
    colleges and institutes, and especially on academic staff and
    research students; and to study problems associated with the
    organisation of a travelling workshop. discusses the use of an

    <text>a reader's view of east asian catalogue automation.
    discusses whether automation is preferable for catalogues of
    chinese language materials in australia. presents a brief
    history of cataloguing and classification in china. the
    romanised catalogue in alphabetical order is most suited to
    automation but a supplementary character-based catalogue for
    large east asian holdings would help users more familiar with
    characters and with different pronunciations in different
    languages and dialects. suggests that librarians should hold
    back automation until an integrated system which can cope with
    both romanised and character data at a reasonable cost is
    developed and then aim for a centralised cataloguing system for
    all east asian materials throughout australia, possibly based
    on the national library of australia but with input from all
    libraries with east asian materials.</text>

    <text>syntax-directed documentation for pl 360 the language pl
    360, together with its phrase structure grammar, is used as a
    concrete basis for illustrating an idea called syntax-directed
    documentation. this idea is (1) to use the phrase structure of
    a program to define the structure of a formal documentation for
    that program; (2) to use the syntactic types and identifiers in
    the resulting structure to trigger the automatic formation of
    questions to the programmer, whose answers will become part of
    that documentation; and (3) to provide automatic storage and
    retrieval facilities so that other programmers who want to
    understand or modify the program can access the resulting
    documentation, which is cross-indexed in various ways by
    syntactic types and objects. a small pl 360 program, already
    found in the literature, is worked out as an example. april,

    <text>some comments on the use of ambiguous decision tables and

    recently published work on decision table translation using
    methods similar to the rule-mask technique. the applicability
    of these methods under various possible conventions on overall
    table meaning is discussed, and it is argued that there is a
    place both for the multi-rule and the single-rule (or action
    set) convention in decision tale usage. may, 1973 king, p. j.

    <text>a case study in programming for parallel-processors an
    affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of
    whether it is possible to program parallel-processor computing
    systems to efficiently decrease execution time for useful
    problems. parallel-processor systems are multiprocessor systems
    in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute
    separate tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
    the solution time of a computational problem. the processors
    have independent instruction counters, meaning that each
    processor executes its own task program relatively
    independently of the other processors. communication between
    cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by
    all processors. a program for the determination of the
    distribution of current in an electrical network was written
    for a parallel-processor computing system, and execution of
    this program was simulated. the data gathered from simulation
    runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem,
    typical of a large class of important problems. it is shown
    that, with proper programming, solution time when n processors
    are applied approaches 1/n times the solution time for a single
    processor, while improper programming can actually lead to an
    increase of solution time with the number of processors.
    stability of the method of solution was also investigated.

    <text>bibliographic access for microform collections.
    bibliographic access to individual titles in microform
    collections is a problem. neither the library of congress nor
    most micropublishers fully analyse these collections.
    individual libraries cannot afford to do so either. but without
    author and title access, these collections are not very useful.
    full analytics for microform collections have been called for
    but no effort yet has been successful. suggests that libraries
    abandon full cataloguing in favour of indexing, using the
    information provided by micropublishers. while a national index
    to the contents of microform collections would be best, an
    alternative for local libraries would be to create their own

    <text>conversion of decision tables by rule mask method without

    algorithms are based on the rule mask method but need not have
    the masks at execution time. they perform the logical
    operations immediately rather than at the end of the
    interpreting process. execution time can be considerably
    reduced by instantly marking rules which are not applicable
    (algorithms 1 and 2) or conditions which are already tested
    (algorithm 2). the new algorithms combine to a certain degree
    the advantages of mask methods with those of tree methods.

    <text>generating parsers for affix grammars affix grammars are
    two-level grammars which are similar to van wijngaarden's
    two-level grammars used in the definition of algol 68. affix
    grammars are shown by koster to be equal in power to van
    wijngaarden grammars. they are much more suited to parsing than
    are the latter, however. koster, the inventor of affix based on
    recursive procedures. this paper presents a bottom-up scheme
    for parsing them, based on an extension of floyd production
    language (fpl). included is an algorithm, similar to that of
    deremer's, for converting a large class of affix grammars into
    fpl. the paper concludes by discussing briefly the
    applicabilities of the conversion algorithm and affix grammars
    in general, and some possible extensions to koster's definition
    of affix grammars. august, 1972 crowe, d. algorithmic language

    <text>a cost oriented algorithm for data set allocation in
    storage hierarchies data set allocation in today's multilevel
    storage systems is usually based on qualitative, ad hoc
    decisions. while it would be desirable to obtain an optimal
    solution to this allocation problem, it is clear that the
    number of parameters involved makes it intractable to
    straight-forward solution. in such a situation, we must find a
    set of assumptions which simplify the problem greatly, but
    which still provide a basis for considering all significant
    cost elements. this paper presents such a first, quantitative
    allocation step. it considers many of the significant detailed
    costs of system utilization, data storage, data staging, and
    data migration. although many avenues of further improvement
    are available, the present algorithm seems to be usefully
    accurate. as such, it can aid in quantifying the problems of
    data set allocation, storage system configuration, and new
    device designs. june, 1975 lum, v. y. senko, m. e wang, c. p.

    <text>the management of technological innovation. a paper
    presented at a 1979 quebec corporation des bibliothecaires
    professionnels conference, considering how librarians should
    approach the introduction of new technology. the necessity of
    planning is illustrated by examples of various canadian
    university projects, and the sophisticated management
    procedures of today compared with the early experimental phase
    in the 1960s. planning involves consideration of costs,
    benefits and operational satisfaction in the preliminary phase,
    while implementation chiefly involves management of human
    relations, and the adoption of a systematic approach to change
    which takes account of the wider implications of altering
    current practices. librarians attitudes to automation vary, but
    the essential goal is improvement of existing techniques, not
    innovation for its own sake, with the emphasis on economic
    management, efficient service provision, and harmonious user

    <text>analysing information-flow in science and technology with
    citation networks. science citation index and social sciences
    citation index are being used in 3 kinds of information-flow
    study. in the 1st, information retrieval, it is usually simple
    to find a small amount of specific information, often all that
    may be needed. in the 2nd (construction of maps of
    citation-connected articles for historical studies) and 3rd
    (using citations as 'quality' or 'impact' indicators), 'noise'
    will appear and may be eliminated by certain techniques, which
    are described. a number of examples of these applications are
    described in several quite different subject areas.</text>

    existence as a response to the separate needs of academic

    years-some see it as an equal partnership, others as a
    parent/adolescent child relationship. a 1981 summit meeting in

    this formula is compared to two standard integration methods,

    equations, the exponential formula has superior stability
    properties for large step sizes. thus this formula may be used

    branches. describes the logan square experimental book branch

    provide a better service to existing users and makes no attempt
    to 'outreach' to the community. staff resources have decreased
    during the experiment and the book budget is consistent with
    those of similarly-sized libraries. in 1978-79 (the
    experiment's 1st year), the bookstock was increased from 45,000
    to 66,500 volumes (mainly by accepting discards from other
    branches) and a magazine collection was started. after
    declining for 10 years, circulation increased by 19% in 1979.
    it is too early to analyse the experiment's results, but the
    future looks good. perhaps this is a true measure of public

    <text>public library research. interview with n. moore, project

    library. defines research as theoretical research, which
    provides general background information on libraries and their
    users, and research which seeks to solve specific problems and
    help librarians provide better services. public libraries are
    mainly interested in the latter. recent research has begun to
    look at why people use public libraries and the results are
    being used to improve services. the british library supports
    research investigating resource distribution, cooperation and
    staff organisation in public libraries and examining the role
    of public libraries in relation to further education. this
    research is as far as possible carried out by practising
    librarians, often in conjunction with the library schools. the
    british library also finances research centres, which initiate
    research, build up collections of resource material and advise
    researchers. an advisory comm ittee on public library research

    our concern for freedom of expression, many handicapped are
    denied access to the spoken and printed word. libraries have an

    direct physical accessibility means that the handicapped can
    reach the library, enter it and stay there. but improved
    buildings and transport cannot replace the domiciliary library
    service. indirect accessibility means that library activities
    and media must be adapted to reach new groups. 'easy readers'

    performance is given. while a great deal of information and a
    large number of models for subsystems have been developed, gaps
    still exist in out knowledge. because of the severe
    interactions between the various subsystems of an operating
    system, an overall model of the total system must be developed
    to be able to analyze and design the performance aspects of an
    operating system although such total system designs are
    exceptional today, it is projected that they will become
    increasingly more common and necessary in the near future. such
    a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact on the
    way we go about modularizing operating and computer systems.

    <text>n.k. krupskaya and current problems in the organisation
    of library services to rural populations. raising the cultural
    level of life in the countryside is still a major task of
    soviet librarianship in the 1980s. recent developments have
    produced great quantitative improvements in rural library
    services, but qualitatively much still needs to be done. n.k.
    krupskaya was closely involved with this very problem in the
    1930s and her recommendations are still valid today. if what
    she wrote then can be put into practice now, the gap between
    the levels of service in town and country can be rapidly

    in unit time). the method has the same arithmetic complexity as
    the algorithm presented by mairson [6]; however, our version is

    especially suitable for use in writing production software
    systems for a specific machine (the pdp-10): compilers,
    operating systems, etc. prime design goals of the design are
    the ability to produce highly efficient object code, to allow
    access to all relevant hardware features of the host machine,
    and to provide a rational means by which to cope with the
    evolutionary nature of systems programs. a major feature which
    contributes to the realization of these goals is a mechanism
    permitting the definition of the representation of all data
    structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the
    structure. december, 1971 wulf, w. a. russell, d. b.

    which requires the compilation of a register of books and
    authors entitled to payment. discusses the consultative
    document on this scheme which was published in 1980, and
    indicates some of the problems which are likely to arise when

    <text>storage reorganization techniques for matrix computation
    in a paging environment in order to multiply matrices while
    minimizing the number of page fetches required, it is often
    more efficient to reorganize the data into submatrix form and
    to use block multiplication rather than to use the best known
    algorithms which leave the matrices stored in row-(or
    column-)oriented form. an efficient method for accomplishing
    this reorganization is given. this also makes possible the
    derivation of an asymptotically better bound for multiplication
    of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting the
    technique of strassen to the reorganized data. the
    reorganization/block multiplication scheme is shown to be
    advantageous for matrices and pages of realistic size; the
    strassen adaptation is not. the former scheme is also shown to
    be advantageous even if the transpose of one of the matrices is
    available at no additional cost. july, 1979 fischer, p.c.

    shown that given some care in use the unit performs
    satisfactorily under the conditions tested, even though it is
    operating across a memory-to-storage interface with a very
    large speed difference. the disadvantages of prefolding, which
    is required when the folding is manual, are examined, and a
    number of the important troubles which beset computing today
    are shown to arise from, or be aggravated by, this source. it
    is concluded that a folding mechanism will probably become a
    normal part of most computing systems. december, 1969 sayre, d.

    <text>first, do no harm' giving advice about
    photo-conservation. in 1979 in the usa, over 10 billion
    exposures were made by 45 billion cameras, but most of these
    photographs will eventually be lost, thrown away, self-destruct
    or be forgotten before anyone even thinks of preserving them
    for posterity. many institutions have already amassed too many
    photographs, and so perhaps preservation must be carried out by
    the photographs' originators. only now is some effort being
    made to establish programmes for the formal training of
    conservators, and most amateurs still want cheap, quick and
    easy solutions. it falls to librarians, archivists and
    curators, therefore to make useful information readily
    available to those who ask for it and to be prepared to carry
    it to those who do not. presents a list of useful and recent

    <text>comparison of several algorithms for computation of

    algorithms for computation of basic statistics are compared by
    their performance on systematically generated test data. the
    statistics calculated were the mean, standard deviation and
    correlation coefficient. for each statistic, the algorithm
    included the usual computing formulas, correction due to an
    accumulated error term, and a recursive computation of the
    current value of the statistic. the usual computing formulas
    were also evaluated in double precision. large errors were
    noted for some calculation using the usual computing formulas.
    the most reliable technique was correction of the initial
    estimate by use of an accumulated error term. to eliminate the
    need for making two passes on the data, it was suggested that
    the initial estimate of the mean be obtained from a subset of
    the data. july, 1966 neely, p. m. ca660703 jb march 6, 1978

    <text>a pl/i program to assist the comparative linguist a
    practical pl/i program is described which can assist
    comparative linguists to determine the regular sound
    correspondences between genetically related languages. the
    investigator must arrange data for input by aligning pairs of
    suspected cognates. the program tabulates the correspondences,
    and uses list processing techniques to sort and count them.
    each pair of words is then assigned a relative value that is a
    function of the total frequency in the data of each
    correspondence found in that pair of words. the output is a
    list of all correspondence types with their frequency of
    occurrence in the data, and a separate listing of each
    correspondence with all word-pairs showing that correspondence
    (unless their relative value is below an arbitrarily chosen
    cutoff point). the article explains the usefulness, as well as
    the limitations, of the programs, and illustrates its use with
    a small portion of hypothetical data. june, 1970 frantz, d. g.

    <text>entry of local data on oclc' the options and their impact
    on the processing of archival tapes. the oclc system allows for
    a great deal of flexibility in entering institution specific
    data for an item. in the past, policies for entering local data
    have been formulated in many libraries on the basis of
    catalogue card appearance, but the increasing use of oclc tape
    products requires reexamination of many of the local data
    practices now in use. a survey was conducted by the
    bibliographical center for research in order to determine the
    extent of variations for entering local data on the part of bcr
    oclc libraries. the results are presented here, along with a
    discussion of alternative practices and their impact on the

    <text>space requirements of university libraries. the council
    for scientific information published its report on space
    requirements for university libraries in may 81. the report
    deals with 22 university libraries. in the 70s the total annual
    growth of shelf metres was about 3%. the council forecasts a
    growth of about 4% for the 80s. it does not think that the
    developments in microforms and computerised services will
    change the situation in the next 15 to 20 years. some of the
    council's recommendations are' shelf measurement for
    collections should be the following' open shelves 6.3 metres
    per sq metre; closed access 8 shelf metres per sq metre;
    storage 9.3 metres per sq metre; and stacks 19 metres per sq
    metre. a national cooperative storage library should be
    established. libraries should have more enclosed reading rooms
    and research rooms.</text>

    <text>value conflicts and social choice in electronic funds
    transfer system developments during the last few years,
    computer-based systems which automate the transfer and
    recording of debits and credits have begun to be implemented on
    a large scale. these systems promise both financial benefits
    for the institutions that use them and potential conveniences
    to their customers. however, they also raise significant
    social, legal, and technical questions that must be resolved if
    full scale systems for electronic funds transfer (eft) are not
    to cause more problems for the larger public than they solve.
    this paper examines the incentives for eft developments and the
    social problems they raise in the context of conflicts between
    five different value positions that are often implicit in
    analyses of proposed eft arrangements. these conflicts reflect
    the relative importance of certain problems for specific
    groups. the value positions implicit in eft proposals help to
    organize analyses of market arrangements, system reliability,
    and privacy of transactions. these topics are analyzed in this
    article and related to the value positions held by concerned
    parties. last, the ways in which the public can learn about the
    social qualities of different eft arrangements and the pace of
    eft developments are both discussed in the context of social
    choice. august, 1978 kling, r. electronic funds transfer

    <text>prevention of system deadlocks a well-known problem in
    the design of operating systems is the selection of a resource
    allocation policy that will prevent deadlock. deadlock is the
    situation in which resources have been allocated to various
    tasks in such a way that none of the tasks can continue. the
    various published solutions have been somewhat restrictive:
    either they do not handle the problem in sufficient generality
    or they suggest policies which will on occasion refuse a
    request which could have been safely granted. algorithms are
    presented which examine a request in the light of the current
    allocation of resources and determine whether or not the
    granting of the request will introduce the possibility of a
    deadlock. proofs given in the appendixes show that the
    conditions imposed by the algorithms are both necessary and
    sufficient to prevent deadlock. the algorithms have been
    successfully used in the the system. july, 1969 habermann, a.

    <text>an algorithm for deriving the equations of mathematical
    physics by symbolic manipulation a method is described whereby
    a digital computer can be used to derive the equations of
    mathematical physics in any curvilinear coordinate system
    requested by the user. the effectiveness of the technique is
    demonstrated by using it to derive the navier-stokes equations
    of fluid motion and the continuity equation. to derive these
    equations by this method, the user need know only the
    coordinate transformation equations relating the curvilinear
    coordinates of interest to an orthogonal cartesian triad. when
    this program is used and the coordinate transformation
    equations are supplied as input, the computer will derive the
    navier-stokes equations and the continuity equation. the
    equations obtained will be relative to the curvilinear
    coordinate system specified by the transformation equations
    used as input. in this paper the emphasis is on theoretical
    considerations and methodology rather than on programming
    details. results are presented for cylindrical polar and
    spherical polar coordinate systems. december, 1968 howard, j.

    converting from base 10 to base 2, and by using a table of the
    coefficient of a polynomial approximation of 10^x,
    (0&lt;=x&lt;1) for converting from base 2 to base 10. these
    tables occupy a large storage region in the case of a nonsingle

    <text>discussion and communication for staff in the hoogeveen
    public library. in 1971 a scheme of worker participation was
    introduced at hoogeveen public library in the netherlands.
    previously staff meetings were restricted to administrative
    staff only. under the new system weekly meetings were held at
    which the chief librarian and heads of the adult and children's
    departments were present. reports of these meetings were
    circulated to all heads of departments. in 1975 following the
    opening of a new central library the library service was
    reorganised into 8 departments and a new structure of staff
    meetings was introduced. in addition to the meetings attended
    by administrative staff and heads of departments, all staff of
    the internal services meet every 3 weeks, while staff of the
    external services meet each week. the purpose of these meetings
    is to improve staff motivation and thereby the quality of the
    library's services.</text>

    <text>how shall the library approach the immigrants?. the
    library services to immigrants in denmark are governed by the
    general rule of equal access to library services. for practical
    reasons, this means that part of the service must be
    centralised, viz. selection, acquisition and preparation of the
    material. gentofte public library has since 1970 had a central
    collection of immigrant literature available to other
    libraries. the choice of material must be made in consultation
    with people knowledgeable about the groups and their conditions
    in the new country. the selection must also reflect the need,
    not only for fictional, but also for informative literature
    both about the homeland and the adopted country. more
    audio-visual material and a better classification system are
    necessary. the efforts of the local library catering for very
    small groups of immigrants must, apart from collections of
    reference works and classics, be concentrated on contact work
    and cultural arrangements.</text>

    canada, india and israel, indexed in science citation index. a
    citation analysis follows. amongst the findings were that most
    of the journals cite more than they are cited, local journals

    <text>librarians and their work among readers. there are 346
    public libraries in the turgovishche region. (north-east
    bulgaria) with collections of more than 1 1/2 million volumes,
    i.e. about 9 books per head of the population. each reader
    borrows, on average, almost 13 books every year. 1/3 of the
    171,000 inhabitants in the area are turks catered for by 47
    librarians. after literacy courses and reading aloud in the
    early post-war years, the librarians' efforts can now be geared
    to attracting readers from every family. libraries are helped
    by clubs of young friends of books as well as by other
    organisations. discussions on significant works of literature
    and other events are arranged by the libraries to encourage the
    turkish population to attain a higher standard of living and to
    take pride in their socialist homeland. results of the
    concerted efforts can be demonstrated most tangibly in the
    changed life of turkish women. veiled in the recent past, they
    work now, not only in agriculture, bu t in many other fields.
    they also sing in mixed choirs and appear on the stage.
    however, as the knowledge of the bulgarian language has become
    more widespread among the turks in bulgaria, the reading of
    books in turkish has followed a progressive downward

    they were either acquired as a unit or specifically assembled
    by the library. although valuable resources, these collections
    are often challenging to use as they are not recorded in a
    single card catalogue or machine-readable data base but rather
    in a variety of bibliographic guides. furthermore, some special
    collections are so vast that it is not feasible to provide an

    resources that might otherwise be overlooked and describes
    special collections that have been singled out by the library's
    reference staff for their rarity or potential interest to
    scholars and summarises the history, content, scope, subject
    strengths and organisation of these groups of materials. though
    limited to 269 of the many special collecti ons, it illustrates

    <text>the simulation of time sharing systems the development of
    new large scale time-sharing systems has raised a number of
    problems for computation center management. not only is it
    necessary to develop an appropriate hardware configuration for
    these systems, but appropriate software adjustments must be
    made. unfortunately, these systems often do not respond to
    changes in the manner that intuition would suggest, and there
    are few guides to assist in the analysis of performance
    characteristics. the development of a comprehensive simulation
    model to assist in the investigation of these questions is
    described in this paper. the resulting model has a general
    purpose design and can be used to study a variety of
    time-sharing systems. it can also be used to assist in the
    design and development of new time-sharing algorithms or
    techniques. for the sake of efficiency and greater
    applicability, the model was implemented in a limited fortran
    subset that is compatible with most fortran iv compilers. the
    use of the simulation is demonstrated by a study of the ibm
    360/67 time-sharing system. july, 1967 nielsen, n. r. ca670701

    <text>some comments on the future of public librarianship.
    since world war ii there has been an unprecedented growth in
    the netherlands in the provision of public services, including
    medical care, social welfare and education. this growth has not
    been achieved in an orderly manner but has come about by the
    sudden expansion of separate sectors. in the last 10 years
    control of the public services has become a subject for much
    discussion in the dutch parliament with the result that the
    government has made provision for members of the public to have
    a greater say in the running of these services. in future
    factors which will seriously affect public library services
    include the slowdown in economic growth, increased unemployment
    and the reduced birth-rate. to meet these challenges a reform
    of local government services is necessary.</text>

    <text>an operating system based on the concept of a supervisory
    computer an operating system which is organized as a small
    supervisor and a set of independent processes are described.
    the supervisor handles i/o with external devices-the file and
    directory system-schedules active processes and manages memory,
    handle errors, and provides a small set of primitive functions
    which it will execute for a process. a process is able to
    specify a request for a complicated action on the part of the
    supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrence of a compound
    event in the system) by combining these primitives into a
    "supervisory computer program." the part of the supervisor
    which executes these programs may be viewed as a software
    implemented "supervisory computer." the paper develops these
    concepts in detail, outlines the remainder of the supervisor,
    and discusses some of the advantages of this approach. march,

    the optimal set of network sites at which to locate copies of a

    heuristics and other aids to finding optimal, or near-optimal,
    solutions are therefore much needed. in this paper we present
    three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate that
    certain sites should (or should not) be included in an optimal

    <text>descriptran-automated descriptive geometry* descriptive
    geometry consists of procedures originally designed to solve
    3-space geometry problems by graphical constructions and
    measurement instead of by computation. however, in addition to
    this it unifies and simplifies the approach to many such
    problems. when one can call subroutines that compute new
    coordinates that correspond to those obtainable from the
    graphical constructions, there is the three-way advantage of
    the approach of descriptive geometry, the accuracy of
    computation and the speed of the digital computer. descriptran
    makes it possible to program many problems in 3-space with a
    few statements; it consists of 15 subroutines analogous to the
    procedures of descriptive geometry. june, 1963 kliphardt, r. a.

    <text>libraries and computers. the debate on computers in
    libraries centres around 2 questions' whether computers on the
    whole are of benefit to users, and whether the bums system in
    particular is of value. introduction of computers means that
    library staff become dependent on experts. as processes become
    automated they also become dehumanised, and readers use
    machines directly with minimal help from staff. some skills are
    lost and replaced with routines. as for the bums system, some
    routines have merely replaced others. a traditional card
    catalogue is easier to use than the bums catalogue, although
    the latter makes survey of the library's total stock possible.
    but this leads in turn to increase in the number of requests
    within the library system; it favours the active, experienced
    users, but discourages the inexperienced and the browsers. the
    cost of gathering of statistics through through bums and
    training of staff in data technology must be set against other
    possible uses of the resources.</text>

    <text>on quadratic adaptive routing algorithms two analytic
    models of a store-and-forward communications network are
    constructed, one to find the optimal message routing and the
    other to illustrate the equilibrium (stationary state)
    maintained by an adaptive routing algorithm. these models show
    that adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary conditions
    for an optimal routing, adaptive routing tends to overuse the
    direct path and underuse alternate routes because it does not
    consider the impact of its current routing decision on the
    future state of the network. the form of the optimality
    conditions suggests that a modification of the adaptive
    algorithm will result in optimality. the modification requires
    the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead of a linear
    one in the routing table maintained at each network node.
    simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical
    analysis for a simple network. january, 1976 agnew, c. e.

    to and complement each others' activities; the 2nd describes a

    prescribed for the library as a result of its failure to
    develop its own sphere of activity. the last article discusses

    <text>theoretical considerations in information retrieval
    systems information storage and retrieval systems are composed
    of three major components: (a) identification of information
    and tagging it for effective retrieval, (b) searching strategy,
    how to enter the file to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant
    material, and (c) file organization to make access to
    information efficient. for identification of information the
    paper suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed in a
    paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated with an
    object language be used. for searching strategy, a linear model
    for an evaluation function of relevancy is developed which
    rewards the system for retrieving relevant documents and not
    retrieving the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the
    escaped relevant documents and false drops. the inadequacies of
    a linear model are indicated. two approaches to file
    organization are discussed. one is self-organization of the
    file based on its history and past performance, and the second
    is a self-generating subset of the file with a high probability
    of being relevant. july, 1964 belzer, j. goffman, w. ca640715

    <text>a new integration algorithm for ordinary differential

    integration algorithm is found, and an implementation is
    compared with other programmed algorithms. the new algorithm is
    a step-by-step procedure for solving the initial value problem
    in ordinary differential equations. it is designed to
    approximate poles of small integer order in the solutions of
    the differential equations by continued fractions obtained by
    manipulating the sums of truncated taylor series expansions.
    the new method is compared with gragg-bulirsh-stoer, and the
    taylor series method. the taylor series method and the new
    method are shown to be superior in speed and accuracy, while
    the new method is shown to be most superior when the solution
    is required near a singularity. the new method can finally be
    seen to pass automatically through singularities where all the

    <text>regular right part grammars and their parsers this paper
    in troduces an alternative to context-free grammars called
    regular right part (rrp) grammars, which resemble pascal syntax
    diagrams. formally, rrp grammars have production right parts,
    which are nondeterministic finite state machines (fsms), and,
    as a special case, regular expressions, since these can be
    converted to fsms. rrp grammars describe the syntax of
    programming languages more concisely and more understandably
    than is possible with cf grammars. also in troduced is a class
    of parsers, rrp lr(m, k) parsers, which includes the cf lr(k)
    parsers and provides the same advantages. informally, an rrp
    lr(m, k) parser can determine the right end of each handle by
    considering at most k symbols to the right of the handle and
    the left end, after the right end has been found, by
    considering at most m symbols to the left of the handle. a
    mechanism for determining the left end is required because
    there is no bound on the length of the handle. october, 1977

    <text>a string language for symbol manipulation based on algol
    60 an artificial computer programming language is proposed for
    describing the manipulation of strings of characters and
    symbols. the concept of strings, introduced in the algol 60
    report, is extended by adding: (1) the declaration of strings,
    substrings, and string arrays with explicit lengths; (2) the
    ability to concatenate and shift strings; and (3) the ranking
    of symbols for comparing stings in boolean relations. a primer
    or informal description of the language is followed by
    examples, a description of experiments with the language on an
    ibm 704 computer, and a formal description which, taken with
    the algol 60 report, defines the proposed string language.

    <text>library network in the slovak socialist republic and its

    impetus to the whole library network in slovakia. since 1 jan
    82, a special section of matica slovenska, based in bratislava,
    has been in operation. its staff have to watch, direct and
    control both short- and long-term planning in libraries. they
    will also care for coordination between libraries and centres
    of scientific, technical and economic information. contacts
    with libraries in the czech socialist republic as well as
    international connections will also be furthered. the overall
    responsibility for libraries, however, rests upon the slovak
    ministry of culture. for their part, the ministry's officials
    will make every effort towards unification and/or
    standardisation of all library activities, including building
    up book collections, records, statistics and the like. among
    other problems which must be tackled in the forseeable future
    are computerisation, mergers of public and school libraries,

    <text>toward a general processor for programming languages many
    efforts have been made to develop a better way of implementing
    a higher level programming language than by the construction of
    a whole new compiler, but so far none has proved generally
    satisfactory. in this paper, it is contended that a programming
    language is best described functionally as a body of macro
    instructions, and that the macro call constitutes a canonical
    form in terms of which a programming notation may be described.
    a supporting discussion of the logical and his torical role of
    the macro instruction is presented. also discussed are the
    conflict between machine independence and object program
    efficiency, and the question of where the greatest difficulties
    lie in compiler construction. january, 1968 halpern, m. j.

    <text>a neliac-generated 7090-1401 compiler neliac systems for
    several different machines have been generated using the
    original neliac system developed at the naval electronics
    laboratory, san diego, in 1958. a basic "bootstrap" process was
    used to generate all but the first, i.e. the systems were
    described in the neliac language and generated by an existing
    neliac compiler. this experience has shown there is no inherent
    difficulty in "building compilers with compilers"; indeed, it
    pointed out many advantages in using a pol for constructing
    programming systems. this report presents the results of a
    project completed in may, 1961 in which the neliac system was
    used to generate a compiler for the ibm 1401. the 1401
    compiler, which runs on the 7090 and produces 1401 programs,
    was described in the neliac language and generated with 7090
    neliac system. the reduction in programming time and the
    improvement in documentation of the system were very
    significant. february, 1962 watt, j. b. wattenburg, w. h.

    express the subject content accurately. in popular literature
    the title may be eye-catching rather than accurate. problems
    can also be caused by foreign languages, abbreviations,

    <text>on the professional ethics of the librarian from the
    viewpoint of education and training. socialist library systems
    aim to improve the educational level of the people in all
    subjects, to provide sound communist training and to support
    the further growth of socialist society. the education and
    training of librarians must, therefore, be in accordance with
    these objectives. the librarian has a responsibility to society
    to provide for the growing demand for literature and
    information, to further research study and to support socialist
    education. whatever branch of library work the student will
    eventually be involved in, training should not be restricted to
    learning facts and library methodology techniques but should
    also provide a flexible training in the socio-economic aspects
    of library work. a librarian should be able to relate his
    particular social role in his branch of library work to the
    socialist library system as a whole.</text>

    <text>a queueing study of public catalog use. discusses a
    6-week queuing study of public catalogues in the iowa state
    university library system. data gathered are analysed primarily
    to determine if routinely gathered library statistics can
    validly be used to predict catalogue usage, to discover the
    ratio between the usage of the card catalogue and the senate
    catalogue, and to pinpoint the time of peak card catalogue
    usage in order to measure more closely the rate of use. this
    measurement, then, can provide 1 factor in a simulation model
    that can be constructed to predict accurately the number of
    devices needed for an alternative catalogue format.</text>

    <text>in search of 'eternal' problems; young people and the
    classics: the conditions for understanding. library fiction
    issues comprise 2.5% of total issues, classics amounting to 5%
    of this. importance of promoting classical fiction is
    undervalued. children read classics as part of the school
    syllabus but bid farewell to them on leaving. classical
    literature's role in education is underestimated because of
    feelings that children are too young to understand them or are
    not interested. children should be taught how everything
    'interconnects' in russian literature, which asks the same

    <text>the fact database: a system based on inferential methods.
    the fact data base (a model for a new type of
    information-handling system) is described in terms of its main
    data structure (built from units of information called 'facts')
    and its conceptual section which manipulates the structure (the
    fact machine). its novelty arises from its internal knowledge
    structure-a model of the real world described by the data base
    and representation of information fed to the machine. this,
    augmented by information about set membership, enables the
    system to use inferential methods in many aspects of its
    operation. shows how these features lead to a simple, flexible
    interface, both to other computer systems and to 'user

    <text>great differences in the financial position and level of
    services of research libraries. comments on the sections of a
    report by the research planning council' 2the conditions for
    research in the public sector1 which deal with research
    libraries. the conclusion is that the reduction of funds
    available for acquisition of literature has led to severe
    problems for research. analysis of the development in the 1970s
    shows increase in expenditure on staff and fall in the real
    value of that for acquisitions, together with a doubling of
    issues. the comemnts on libraries are scattered throughout the
    report, but can be classed as those that mention' libraries
    without problems of acquisition, or libraries where problems
    have not yet arisen, and libraries with considerable problems.
    arts faculties have seen an increase in subjects and foreign
    specialised literature coinciding with a decrease in book
    grants. in the natural science faculties, institute libraries
    have been forced to acquire books which would normally have
    been borrowed from a research library; gaps are appearing in
    runs of periodicals, and reference works are in short supply.
    service level has gone down as a result of undermanning of
    libraries. some libraries, for example those of the
    agricultural and the commercial high schools, stand out as
    particularly hard hit.</text>

    <text>fingers or fists? (the choice of decimal or binary
    representation) the binary number system offers many advantages
    over a decimal representation for a high-performance,
    general-purpose computer. the greater simplicity of a binary
    arithmetic unit and the greater compactness of binary numbers
    both contribute directly to arithmetic speed. less obvious and
    perhaps more important is the way binary addressing and
    instruction formats can increase the overall performance.
    binary addresses are also essential to certain powerful
    operations which are not practical with decimal instruction
    formats. on the other hand, decimal numbers are essential for
    communicating between man and the computer. in applications
    requiring the processing of a large volume of inherently
    decimal input and output data, the time for decimal-binary
    conversion needed by a purely binary computer may be
    significant. a slower decimal adder may take less time than a
    fast binary adder doing an addition and two conversions. a
    careful review of the significance of decimal and binary
    addressing and both binary and decimal data arithmetic,
    supplemented by efficient conversion instructions. december,

    <text>a procedure for inverting large symmetric matrices in the

    elements of a symmetric positive-definite matrix. in order to
    solve the normal equations and evaluate the precision measures
    of the resulting parameters, inversion of this matrix of
    coefficients is required. many available procedures for matrix
    inversion do not take advantage of the symmetry. thus, when
    programmed for a high-speed computer, all n^2 elements must be
    stored and manipulated, whereas only (n + 1)/2 of them are
    independent. in order to allow a computer of given memory
    capacity to handle a larger matrix, the following procedure for
    inverting a symmetric matrix has been devised. august, 1962

    included sale of books, graphic works, ceramics and glass,
    literacy discussions at club evenings, poetry recitals, quizzes
    and bazaars, with the welcome participation of 19 different

    staff as educational psychologists and social workers also
    found in schools. librarians experienced in the provision of
    children's library services are in the best position to
    organise school libraries with their growing collections of

    teleordering, a computer based communication system between
    booksellers and publishers using isbns. gives brief technical
    details of the hardware used, and describes a typical operation
    sequence. shows that teleordering is an easy to use and
    efficient means of sending orders and hopefully eventually,
    cancellations and possibly chasers. notes some of the
    implications of teleordering for librarians, particularly the
    better service on supply of books and of reports. suggests that
    the booksellers association and the library association should
    consider the possible uses of teleordering together.</text>

    <text>political literature in scientific libraries. bearing in
    mind the importance of ideological education of every single
    citizen in a socialist country, the staff in scientific
    libraries are bound to pay due attention to political and other
    literature in the field of social sciences. it is desirable to
    set up special committees which have to find ways of maximising
    the effect of political literature upon readers. resolute
    policies must be pursued, starting with acquisition, which, in
    particular with respect to foreign political literature, must
    be highly selective. cataloguing and building up of
    bibliographic resources must satisfy the readers' needs in
    speedy current awareness. exhibitions on the occasion of
    important political anniversaries and topical events,
    establishment of specialised reading and study rooms, and also
    more intense research into the use of political literature are
    only a few of the suggestions to attract scientists to study
    this kind of literature permanently and to bene fit by it in
    their professional careers.</text>

    <text>teletext systems are approaching with caution. comments
    on the report by the teletext committee, set up in 1978 by the
    prime minister's office to examine whether there was any
    justification for introducing 1 or more teletext systems in
    denmark and to evaluate the costs involved. the report
    recommends the introduction of text-tv, which is regarded as a
    useful and cheap means of texting tv programmes and
    distributing general information. teledata's direct connection
    to data bases with unlimited information makes it especially
    useful for information searches. it can also be used by
    libraries for location of books, loan information, and readers'
    advice. other uses include' updating of reference works and all
    social information of a changing nature' timetables, address
    lists, etc. however, teledata is very costly and demands a high
    degree of adaptability by users. its introduction as a
    permanent public service should therefore await the results of
    the planned experiment expected in 1983 and sho uld also be
    discussed by the media commission.</text>

    <text>information as a source of energy. report of a joint
    study held in paris in nov 81, attended by representatives of
    all the 5 french professional associations concerned with
    library and information work, to examine the information
    publications available to professionals. the opening session
    covered the 5 reviews published by professional associations,
    and 3 general reviews published by independent agencies; the
    editors concerned gave details, reported in summary, of subject
    coverage, readership, circulation, and frequency. the other
    main session covered french publications dealing with
    information science bibliography; here also the 5 editors
    concerned described the basic organisation and structure of
    their bulletins, and then discussed at length their sources of
    bibliographical information. the report summarises the general
    debates held on relations between the information profession
    and public institutions, and between the profession and the
    press, and concludes with a brief outline of the arguments
    presented for establishing an information bureau to serve the

    <text>toward an understanding of data structures this paper
    presents a notation and formalism for describing the semantics
    of data structures. this is based on directed graphs with named
    edges and transformations on these graphs. in addition, an
    implementation facility is described which could be part of a
    programming language, which allows a programmer who has
    expressed the semantics of an algorithm in terms of the graphs
    to then specify the implementation of some of his data
    structures in order to gain efficiency. october,1971 earley, j.

    <text>modular indexing in a relationally based document
    retrieval system. when based on a single model, a document
    retrieval system may be coherently designed, convenient to use,
    and easy to maintain. the relational model provides a natural
    way of viewing document retrieval and has a sound theoretical
    foundation. a particular area of interest is indexing. all
    indexingtools (including negative dictionaries, stem
    dictionaries, and thesauri) are stored as relations and are
    manipulated using relational operations. this procedure means
    that, conceptually, all indexing is done at search time in a
    modular and dynamic fashion. describes this modular approach,
    gives examples, and summarises the advantages.</text>

    <text>state support for ecclesiastical public libraries in
    bavaria. during the last 30 years it has been affirmed that
    financial support of public libraries run by the churches is
    needed at state and national level because they are public
    libraries. church public library achievements at this time
    include stock increases, the development of staff training and
    social service within librarianship. it is disputed as to
    whether they are religious rather than public libraries and
    whether centralised services for them are too costly. the
    smaller branches could be regarded as a hindrance to the mobile
    libraries and the use of voluntary staff could be an excuse not
    to employ full-time administrators. a plurality of library
    authorities can be regarded as economic. financial assistance
    for all public libraries is provided by the state, especially
    in places where the church library may be the only public
    library.</text>

    preliminary details are given of the political and economic
    situation of the ivory coast, the most developed of the former
    african colonies. a detailed investigation of information
    services was effected to establish whether information
    provision produced development, or resulted from it. details
    are given of resources and services, national and international
    network links, expenditure, and government information policy.
    formal and informal communication channels are analysed with
    particular reference to the national library and national
    archives, where the excellence of the collections is not fully
    exploited because of inadequate resources, as compared to the
    electrical energy information centre, which is financially well
    supported. recommendations for future policy include
    cooperation with other african states, the elaboration of a
    coherent national information policy, the imp osition of
    charges for information services, and the development of
    training programmes in information use. the evidence, it is

    library services must react and develop in relation to social
    change. they must cater for the needs of both urban and rural
    communities, where town and country planning has so often
    failed. working hours are shorter now than in the past, so
    libraries must develop facilities for educational and
    recreational reading in conjunction with the mass media.
    children use libraries more than adults but the birth rate has
    fallen and there are more elderly people in the community today
    than before; this, however, is no excuse for a decline in
    library standards. libraries must become communication centres,
    in particular to help the many people living alone and the 4
    million foreigners in west germany.</text>

    promote reading among the working classes. in factory
    libraries, as opposed to public libraries, there are more adult
    readers than teenage readers and more male readers than female.
    many people consider that adults need to read more than the

    <text>libraries' role in information on developing countries.
    when the united nations was established in 1945, serious
    efforts 1st began to disseminate information on developing
    countries. the united nations has over 300 depot libraries, 14
    of them in scandinavia. international development agencies
    exist in all 5 scandinavian countries. in some countries
    information is available from these agencies, but in others
    only from non-government organisations. special libraries exist
    in several scandinavian institutions, research being
    particularly concentrated on africa, asia and latin america.
    several countries have specialised research institutes.
    supplementary information must be sought in large general
    public and special libraries, and from local humanitarian,
    political and religious organisations. a pan-scandinavian
    bibliography of relevant data bases would be valuable.
    librarians recognise a need for better organised documentation;
    library associations in denmark, norway and sweden have
    establish ed committees of developing countries. scandinavian
    national and regional committees on these lines are desirable
    to coordinate accessions and establish area and subject

    auction records, containing at its inception, over 100,000
    records of sales from sept 75 to aug 79, to be expanded by
    fortnightly additions. describes search procedures, based on
    natural language. bookline will be available to those without
    access to a computer for a fee. search costs are $60 per hour,
    so a single search costs between 65 and 90 cents, with cheaper
    rates for a series of searches. the service will have a

    cataloguing, bibliography and preservation of book collections,
    but also standardisation, research and statistics in libraries,
    as well as continuing education of librarians. special
    committees attend to the running of public and school
    libraries, and also to libraries in higher education. the
    entire network is headed by the slovak library council
    established in the 1950s. the main objective of the council's
    annual plans is to meet the targets set by the slovak ministry
    of culture. following a careful and thorough examination in the

    with the help of regression analysis, linear connections were
    made with a strongly emphasised correlation between the number
    of descriptors and the non-descriptors. then the number of
    non-descriptors was found to increase more slowly than that of
    the descriptors, demonstrating that the proportion of
    non-descriptors to the total vocabulary decreases as the number
    of descriptors increases. the inis thesaurus (international

    integral part of their essential operations. cost-effective
    networks are characterised by greater competition, less state

    <text>information technology. a true on-line catalogue requires
    bibliographic records of at least 350-400 characters per title,
    a minimum of 6 access points, and a sufficient number of
    terminals to offer all users prompt access. a library may
    develop an on-line catalogue by purchasing software from
    another library or joining a turnkey system whereby a company
    provides all hardware, software, installation, training, and
    maintenance at a contracted price. issues to be considered when
    examining the options include data base content, fullness of
    records, authority control, access keys, boolean logic, user
    friendliness, display formats, security, and back-up provision.
    libraries undertaking on-line catalogues in 1981 are
    pioneers.</text>

    <text>indexing with nominal phrases. indexing with nominal
    phrases is a strict continuation of the development from
    coordinate to syntactic indexing. nominal phrases are user
    oriented and especially suitable for complex terms. a nominal
    phrase consists of a nucleus with a left-hand and/or right-hand
    attribute. attribute and nucleus can occur several times at the
    same hierarchic level. the use of nominal phrase indexing is
    illustrated with descriptions of 3 manual indexing
    systems-titus, casin and gerdok-and 1 automatic system-detect.
    in automatic indexing with nominal phrases a complete syntactic
    analysis is unnecessary; even systems with partial parsing
    routines produce acceptable results. the problem of retrieval
    with nominal phrases is still unsolved.</text>

    <text>the integrated library system of the future. present-day

    while librarians do not act effectively in the political

    than follow. using the analogy of a business office, the author
    proposes an integrated library system of the future with 3

    discussed for the case where there are two distinct classes of
    processes known as "readers" and "writers." the "readers" may
    share the section with each other, but the "writers" must have

    where we wish minimum delay for the readers; the other for the
    case where we wish writing to take place as early as possible.

    been developed. a project consisting of modules which libraries
    can accept gradually has now been developed. the project is
    dependent on' computer registration of libraries' stock,
    decentralised input of data in own terminals, standardisation,
    gradual introduction of modules as they become ready, and
    locally determined selection of modules. the cataloguing module
    will be ready at the end of 1982, the issue and acquisitions

    <text>providing information on current research by way of data

    telecommunications, a great variety of data bases are now
    easily accessible to the public by means of terminals.
    regarding these developments, the national council for
    agricultural research in the netherlands decided to inquire
    into the opinions of scientific researchers working for
    institutions participating in the council, on free access to
    data bases containing information on current research in order
    to find out whether this influences contents and formulation of
    project descriptions. the questions concerned the nature of the
    research, the use of and the input into information systems by
    the scientific researcher in question and his/her attitude
    towards free access to research in progress.</text>

    <text>the contribution of the university library towards the

    contact between lecturer and student was the most important aid
    to education, when advice on reading and work methods could be
    given; they also valued reading suggestions from other
    students. at least 1/2 the students interviewed found the
    library staff helpful in providing guidance on literature
    study. the library was a good place for working, although
    delays in obtaining books sometimes held up the study
    programme. some students felt that concentration on

    <text>variable-precision exponentiation a previous paper
    presented an efficient algorithm, called the recomputation
    algorithm, for evaluating a rational expression to within any
    desired tolerance on a computer which performs
    variable-precision arithmetic operations. the recomputation
    algorithm can be applied to expressions involving any
    variable-precision operations having o(10^(-p) + sum{|ei|})
    error bounds, where p denotes the operation's precision and ei
    denotes the error in the operation's ith argument. this paper
    presents an efficient variable-precision exponential operation
    with an error bound of the above order. other operations such
    as log, sin, and cos, which have simple series expansions, can
    be handled similarly. january, 1973 richman, p. l.

    <text>interim report with major consequences for libraries. the
    latest interim report from the norwegian juel committee on
    local government reform, 2new finance system for county
    authorities1, could seriously affect public libraries. if its
    proposals are implemented, financial arrangements between
    state, county and municipal authorities will be abolished, and
    state subsidies given only where absolutely essential. state
    support of libraries and cultural activities is considered
    neither desirable nor necessary. the state library office, in
    reply, considers the present state grants vital in operating a
    satisfactory library service according to the library act.
    local authorities are not legally obliged to administer county
    libraries; without state support, libraries might receive only
    minimal sums, leading at worst to the closure of county library
    services in some counties. since public and mobile libraries
    are nowadays closely linked to county libraries, this would

    <text>illiteracy in the german federal republic. report on a

    far in advance of those hitherto achieved in west germany.
    researchers must find out who the illiterate are and the best
    ways to reach them; some work is already being done by staff at
    adult education centres, penal institutions and the local
    press. problems of staff and money shortages must be overcome
    and beginners' reading books produced suitable for adults.

    <text>reduction of compilation costs through language
    contraction programming languages tailored to particular groups
    of users can often be constructed by removing unwanted features
    from a general purpose language. this paper describes the use
    of simulation techniques to predict the savings in compilation
    cost achievable by such an approach. the results suggest a
    function which describes the effect of changes in the power of
    a language on the compilation cost of an algorithm expressed in
    that language: when features not actually used by the algorithm
    are removed from the language, the cost of compiling the
    algorithm decreases moderately, but when features that are
    needed are removed, the compilation cost increases sharply.

    processing library materials at the tucson public library. a
    synopsis of 3 studies conducted in the technical services area
    of the tucson public library from jan 77-june 80, this report
    presents estimated costs of acquiring, cataloguing, and
    processing print and nonprint library materials. an average
    cost of $7.00 per book copy and $12.20 per non-print copy is
    developed, and it is demonstrated through a range of costs that
    ordering patterns (i.e., single copies, multiple copies, new
    titles, added titles) make a significant impact on unit costs.
    an organisational chart showing staffing levels, an outline of
    activities of the 3 sections of the technical services area,
    and a summary of automated systems being used at the tucson
    public library are included. report not available from

    <text>on the complexities of asking questions. difficulties in
    interpretation of library surveys. in an investigation into how
    people differ in their understanding of questions in
    library-user surveys, a relatively homogeneous group (students
    on a methodology course and their acquaintances) was asked to
    complete a 2-part questionnaire. part 1 described situations
    that often occur in a library and types of contact with reading
    material and asked respondents whether they would call each
    'library use'. part 2 described the frequency of situations and
    asked for an appropriate adverb, such as 'seldom' or 'often'.
    the responses showed a surprising variation, an indication that
    the questionnaire procedure could result in serious distortion
    if used in a quantitative investigation.</text>

    <text>the facts about censorship in public libraries. in the
    1978/79 academic year students of the frederik muller school of
    librarianship carried out a survey into censorship in public
    libraries in the netherlands. 15 libraries, varying in size
    from small town to large city libraries, were selected, 5 in
    areas with a strong protestant leaning, 5 in roman catholic
    areas and 5 in areas with no strong religious convictions. the
    results showed that the number of controversial books stocked
    by libraries was in direct proportion to the size of the
    library. in addition, despite the assurances of all librarians
    that no form of censorship was practised, fewer books of a
    politically-controversial or pornographic nature were to be
    found in libraries in religious areas. it is clear that
    censorship is still alive in the netherlands in 1981 under the
    guise of 'rejection on ethical grounds'.</text>

    <text>tridiagonalization by permutations tridiagonalizing a
    matrix by similarity transformations is an important
    computational tool in numerical linear algebra. consider the
    class of sparse matrices which can be tridiagonalized using
    only row and corresponding column permutations. the advantages
    of using such a transformation include the absence of round-off
    errors and improved computation time when compared with
    standard transformations. a graph theoretic algorithm which
    examines an arbitrary n x n matrix and determines whether or
    not it can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given. the
    algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number of
    comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number of
    increments are linear in n. this compares very favorably with
    standard transformation methods. if the matrix is permutable
    into tridiagonal form, the algorithm gives the explicit
    tridiagonal form. otherwise, early rejection will occur.

    <text>nma, april 1980, new york: a personal view. personal
    account of the national micrographics association conference
    and exposition, new york, apr 80. the conference theme was
    'focus on productivity', although it was felt that some
    sessions had little relevance to the theme. special interest
    subjects were also covered-computer-related sessions,
    banking/finance sessions and integrated technology sessions.
    delegates were more optimistic about the future of the industry
    than are their uk counterparts. the exposition attracted about
    150 exhibitors. the prime interest was in com, and the

    <text>an axiomatic basis for computer programming in this paper
    an attempt is made to explore the logical foundations of
    computer programming by use of techniques which were first
    applied in the study of geometry and have later been extended
    to other branches of mathematics. this involves the elucidation
    of sets of axioms and rules of inference which can be used in
    proofs of the properties of computer programs. examples are
    given of such axioms and rules, and a formal proof of a simple
    theorem is displayed. finally, it is argued that important
    advantages, both theoretical and practical, may follow from a
    pursuance of these topics. october, 1969 hoare, c. a. r.

    <text>nesseby library' a big effort for a small authority.
    nesseby, in northern norway, is large in area (1,438 sq.kil.)
    but small in population (1,120 inhabitants). after many years
    of inadequate library accommodation, a new community centre
    including a library was opened in 1980, so welcome that the
    increased financial burden is not resented. the library is in
    the basement, but sloping ground allows ample window space. for
    the 1st time there is a loan counter, a librarian's office, and
    adequate access to the 4,500 books. the addition of a proposed
    mobile library would ensure a good library service to the area,
    though expansion will be necessary in time.</text>

    <text>a practical approach to managing resources and avoiding
    deadlocks resource scheduling and allocation can be expensive
    with regard to time and space in multiprogramming or
    time-sharing environments involving large numbers of tasks and
    resources with conflicting requirements. detection and/or
    prevention of deadlocks can require massive amounts of
    additional overhead if efficient usage of resources is to be
    maintained. a resource management program is described which
    uses linked lists along with other techniques to overcome a
    large portion of this overhead. the program, which is currently
    running as part of a large scale general purpose operating
    system, keeps resources relatively active but does not detect
    or prevent all deadlocks in its implemented state. certain
    changes, which would permit more comprehensive levels of
    deadlock prevention/detection at additional cost, have not been
    incorporated in the running system due to the infrequency of
    deadlock situations. may, 1973 frailey, d. j. deadlock,

    presents a formal, mathematically expressed hypothesis

    patron welfare; then derives a formula as the solution to the
    problem of maximising patron welfare subject to the budget
    constraint that the sum of the allocations to the departments
    equals the total fund available. according to the formula, the
    appropriate share of each department depends on its numbers,
    its cost of literature, and on the values of a utility function
    parameter and a selectivity function parameter. discusses

    <text>thoughts on the use of teletext in librarianship.
    teletext (bildschirmtext) was 1st shown to the german public by
    the federal postal services in 1977. a comparison is made
    between teletext, video text and 2-way cable television.
    teletext is particularly useful in libraries; the equipment can
    be used directly by readers and information can be obtained
    from it at any time. since teletext is a text medium for the
    speedy provision of topical information it presents no threat
    to the book, a medium for reading. teletext is also useful in
    library request and loan procedures and its use can be
    implemented in stages, resulting in the reduction of costs for
    work procedures and information provision. teletext contains
    fewer errors than printed material.</text>

    <text>a general-purpose display processing and tutorial system
    adept (a display-expedited processing and tutorial) system is

    communications by employing a display unit to interleave
    tutoring with other computer operations such as simulation,
    programming, and information retrieval. it is written in
    fortran iv (g) for the ibm system/360, model 40, and the ibm
    2250 display unit under operating system/360. adept is a
    cataloged program that controls the standard operating system
    by terminating and rescheduling itself automatically,
    relinquishing computer resources allocated to it, and
    surrendering control to the operating system to perform other
    jobs. it expands the power and flexibility of computer-assisted
    instruction by making immediately available to students,
    teachers, and other users, the full resources (system-cataloged
    programs) of the operating system. language processors and
    compilers, simulation models, mathematical solution techniques,
    stored data, and all other library and user programs can be
    incorporated into instructional material without reprogramming.

    <text>algol 60 confidential the algol 60 report,* when first
    encountered, seems to describe a very complex language which
    will be difficult to learn. the "metalinguistic formulae"
    admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying a language,
    but they are certainly not very readable for a beginner.
    however, experience has shown that once the report is explained
    it is in fact easy to learn algol and to write algorithms in
    it. the language is so general and powerful it can handle an
    enormous class of problems. it is not hard to learn those parts
    of algol present in other compiler languages: how to write
    assignment and go to and for statements, etc. indeed, a lot of
    the unnecessary restrictions imposed by other compiling
    languages have finally been lifted. but algol also allows many
    unobvious things to be written, as we will see later, and
    herein lies a problem: algol seems to have become too general.
    so many restrictions have been lifted that a lot of technical
    details crop up which are hard to learn and to use correctly.
    in this paper some of the more obscure features of the language
    are considered and their usefulness is discussed. remarks are
    based on the authors' interpretations of the algol 60 report.

    developed for this study to rate judgements and collect data.
    results are reported in full and analysed; the calculation
    procedures are explained and demonstrated. it was concluded
    that user and non-user judgements were largely similar;
    disagreements were attributed to inconsistencies between
    subjective user and objective non-user evaluation criteria.
    finally the effectiveness of titles in determining rel evance
    was considered, and the conclusion drawn that frequency of
    profile descriptors in document titles did not differentiate
    relevant from non-relevant documents.</text>

    <text>selected aspects from the change of guidelines on stock
    expansion in libraries in the leipzig area. in 1975 the number
    of stock items per inhabitant in leipzig libraries was slightly
    below the national average, so plans for 1976-80 emphasised
    stock expansion. variable provision standards were calculated
    for central and branch libraries. statistical analysis of
    results for this period shows a large stock budget, so that in
    several areas the required levels of stock provision were
    reached or even exceeded. only some of the most densely
    populated areas fell below the requisite standards. other aims
    for 1976-80 were the expansion and qualitative improvement of
    stocks in the central library and the raising of periodical
    subscription charges. particular difficulty was experienced
    with stocks for rural libraries, especially for part-time
    branch libraries; guidelines for 1981-85 aim to improve this
    aspect of the service.</text>

    17-22 aug 81 the 47th conference of the ifla's general assembly
    will take place in leipzig. the main theme of the conference
    which was suggested by east germany will be 'library national
    institutions and professional organisations'. this theme is
    considered to be of great importance on an international level
    as it provides an opportunity to deal with various aspects of
    national library development and international cooperation with
    special emphasis on the efficiency of library organisations,
    professional methodical centres and national service facilities
    for libraries. about 1,200 people are expected to attend the
    conference which wil be the largest cultural event yet in east
    germany. many libraries and museums in leipzig will be
    organising special exhibitions at this time and a seminar for
    librarians from developing countries will be held in the week
    preceding the confere nce.</text>

    <text>journals read by acrl academic librarians, 1973 and 1978.
    a study was undertaken to identify the amount and kinds of
    professional journal reading being done by acrl (association of
    college and research libraries) academic librarians, with data
    drawn from 2 separate surveys made over a 5-year period of
    time. questionnaires were sent to a sample of acrl members in
    1973 and again in 1978, which ascertained how many journals
    they were reading regularly and what the titles of those
    journals were. illustrations provide a comparison of most
    frequently read titles for 1973 to 1978, with the percentage of
    reader response for each title. for both years surveyed, acrl
    academic librarians averaged approximately 7 journals read on a
    regular basis. a separate analysis of the 1978 data indicated
    that 7 of the titles cited as being read accounted for 80% of
    the journal reading. as had been the case in 1973, more than 9
    in 10 of these academic librarians were regular readers of
    college &amp; research librar ies. however, several other
    titles heavily cited in 1973 lost readership among acrl members
    due to the dramatic appearance of the journal of academic
    librarianship.</text>

    <text>on the construction of a representative synthetic
    workload a general method of constructing a drive workload
    representative of a real workload is described. the real
    workload is characterized by its demands on the various system
    resources. these characteristics of the real workload are
    obtained from the system accounting data. the characteristics
    of the drive workload are determined by matching the joint
    probability density of the real workload with that of the drive
    workload. the drive workload is realized by using a synthetic
    program in which the characteristics can be varied by varying
    the appropriate parameters. calibration experiments are
    conducted to determine expressions relating the synthetic
    program parameters with the workload characteristics. the
    general method is applied to the case of two variables, cpu
    seconds and number of i/o activities; and synthetic workload
    with 88 jobs is constructed to represent a month's workload
    consisting of about 6000 jobs. march, 1974 sreenivasan, k.

    <text>merging with parallel processors consider two linearly

    parallel processors working synchronously. the paper presents
    an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel
    processors, which requires at most 2[log2 (2m+1)]+[3m/p] +
    [m/p][log2 (n/m)] steps. if n = (2^b)m (b an integer), the
    algorithm requires at most 2[log2 (m+1)] + [m/p](2+b) steps. in
    the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude, i.e.
    n=km with k being a constant, the algorithm requires 2[log2
    (m+1)] + [m/p](3+k) steps. these performances compare very
    favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm,
    batcher's algorithm, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/2p)log2 m
    steps in the general case and km/p + ((k+1)/2)(m/p)log2 m in

    <text>analysis of interleaved memory systems using blockage

    the analysis of the model by monte carlo simulation is
    discussed. the simulations investigate the performance of
    various system structures, i.e. schemes for sending instruction
    and data requests to the memory system. performance is measured
    by determining the distribution of the number of memory modules
    in operation during a memory cycle. an important observation
    from these investigations is that separately grouping
    instruction and data requests for memory can substantially
    increase the average number of memory modules in operation
    during a memory cycle. results of the simulations and an
    analytical study are displayed for various system structures.

    <text>interference detection among solids and surfaces in many
    industrial environments it is necessary to determine whether r
    there is interference among components. there are many
    potential interference problems in products made up of
    assemblies of components and in product manufacturing and
    testing. typically, drawings are used in an attempt to detect
    such unwanted interferences, but the two-dimensional, static
    drafting medium does not always show interferences among
    three-dimensional, moving parts. this paper presents a computer
    representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms which
    carry out interference checking among objects so represented.
    objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planar
    surfaces. two types of interference checking are discussed:
    detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and
    detection of collisions among objects moving along specified
    trajectories. january, 1979 boyse, j.w. interference checking,

    <text>education of information users in agriculture. it is now

    and training undergraduates in making use of libraries and
    centres of scientific, technical and economic information,
    firstly at the relevant establishment of higher education and
    later on in their working place, is therefore of the highest
    significance. for greater effect, training should begin during
    compulsory school attendance. since 1977, the school of animal
    breeding and veterinary medicine at stara zagora has been one
    of the pioneers in this field. it is hoped that national

    <text>walter hofmann's and rudolf angermann's contribution to

    walter hofmann published as part 2 of a paper on libraries 2on
    the psychology of the proletariat (zur psychologie das
    proletariats) 1in 1910. he carried out a great deal of research
    into the types of literature working class people read, what
    categories working class readers could be divided into and how
    to influence and improve their reading habits. he also carried
    out an important survey on women's reading. rudolf angermann
    continued and expanded hofmann's work. they both considered the
    stimuli to read certain types of literature to be of great
    importance and angermann formulated a list of different reading
    stimuli. they were both of the opinion that the librarian's
    task was to act as adviser and intermediary between the
    literature and the reader. their aim was to offer good quality
    literature to large sections of the people. today methods of
    reader research continue to be d eveloped in socialist
    countries and aim to achieve an optimal relationship between
    the acquisition and use of literature.</text>

    <text>a quality assurance process in health sciences libraries.
    a goal of libraries is to assure the improvement of library
    services. many use standards as a method of assuring the
    quality of services, but standards have often failed through a
    lack of individual commitment to those standards and to the
    methodology used in establishing them. many segments of the
    health care field have adopted the concept of quality assurance
    and are applying it to the service and care they provide. the
    process has the potential to raise or assure quality of
    service. it involves' selection of a subject for review;
    developing measurable criteria; ratifying the criteria;
    evaluating existing services using the criteria; identifying
    and analysing problems; developing and implementing solutions;
    and reevaluating services. 2 pilot quality assurance studies
    conducted in the midwest health science library network in june
    78 are described. plans are underway to use this process on a
    regional basis.</text>

    <text>children's access to public library services' prince
    george's county memorial public library, maryland, 1980. a
    paper presented at the 41st conference of the graduate library
    school, university of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access
    to services and materials in school and public libraries. in
    the history of public library services in the us, numberless
    regulations have been established to determine what kinds of
    service should be provided for children and what limitations
    should be placed on those services and on the use of materials
    in the library. as facilities for sharing information have
    grown, so have questions about children's access to such
    technological advances as data bases and to interlibrary loan
    programmes. in 1967, the american library association revised
    the 2library bill of rights1 to ensure that library use not be
    denied individuals because they are minors. little research has
    been done on how the intention of this action has been
    implemented or ignored. evaluates 1 library's approach to
    access for children, examining policies, regulations,
    practices, and coordinations that affect such access.</text>

    little distortion between these central and outer parts there
    are two strips of the sheet whose ions and electrons separate
    from each other under the influence of the magnetic field
    partly because these strips become much extended and reduced to

    <text>the small academic library and the new cooperation.
    although spiraling costs and reduced budgets require that small
    academic libraries form clusters to share resources and
    services, consortia and library networks so far have taken only
    tentative or shallow steps in this direction. real and
    meaningful steps can and must be taken to develop joint
    acquisition policies, effective and timely interlibrary loan
    procedures, cooperative reference services, and division of
    responsibility for periodicals. resource utilisation in the
    areas of technical processes, staff, and equipment can be
    improved, and librarians need to adopt an attitude of
    interdependency and shared mutual responsibility. clusters of 5
    to 10 libraries within a limited geographic proximity offer a
    feasible framework with an individual in each committed to seek
    out, develop, and maintain cooperative programmes. report not

    library work. a young librarian challenges his colleagues to
    question the attitude that they have held towards their work
    until now. public libraries are at present in a blind alley.
    librarians have forgotten that books are not simply the sources
    of certain ideas' they are also goods subject to the laws of
    marketing, hence the predominance of best-sellers and trivial
    material on the market. it is wrong to value the ability to
    read above that of playing football; what is vital is
    discrimination and sensitivity towards the actual contents of
    the material read. librarians are after all responsible for all
    their actual and potential readers, by whom their work is
    financed.</text>

    <text>an alternative isbn checking algorithm. the international
    standard book number is well known as a title identifier in
    bibliographic retrieval systems, as a control number for isbn
    assigned monographs appearing on the uk marc record, and as a

    the helpful characteristic that isbns exhibit whereby their
    10th and final character serves as a check-digit, minimising
    data entry errors. other well-known identifiers, such as the
    library of congress number and the british national
    bibliography number which serve respectively as control numbers
    on the lc marc record and on the uk marc record for non-isbn
    assigned monographs, do not exhibit comparable self-validating

    a distinction is made between the behavioural outcomes of the
    reference process, and the causal factors that inhibit the
    delivery of reference service. data are presented on 16
    libraries that participated in a national study of library
    economics. data on behavioural and causal aspects are collected
    and analysed separately; group or composite values for the
    performance parameters are presented. these are transformed to
    provide independent measures of the performance of the staff,
    the collection, and the patrons. group values, together with
    the range and medians, are presented. the question of how the
    librarian's perception of success is related to the patron's
    perception, and to the validity of the answers provided, is

    <text>the literature search that went up in smoke. since 1977,
    the librarians' union has stressed that automation in libraries
    should begin with bibliographic systems. biblioteksdata has
    replied that their development plans agree with this priority,
    but adds that local libraries must be free to decide which
    automation system to use. fears that biblioteksdata, in effect,
    is giving priority to automation of administrative tasks, such
    as issues and acquisitions, although the union has argued the
    need for terminal access for libraries to the bibliographic
    data base. provision of such access has been held up by the
    fact that the question of the best subject search system has
    not yet been solved. meantime, however, attempts should be made
    to provide terminal access with free text searching, similar
    searching on microform, and expansion of bibliographic entries
    with subject words. argues that the limited resources should be
    concentrated on the most important area' services.</text>

    information needs in an inquiry. shows that the relevant
    documents retrieved by the system in response to a
    traditionally-composed inquiry are not necessarily pertinent,
    since the criteria employed by the user when analysing and
    evaluating documents are not included in the inquiry text as
    retrieval characteristics. introduces the concepts of objective
    and subjective information needs and 'retrieval information
    need'. considers the problem of understanding the composition
    of pertinence criteria and their formulation in an inquiry.

    <text>beyond programming languages as computer technology
    matures, our growing ability to create large systems is leading
    to basic changes in the nature of programming. current
    programming language concepts will not be adequate for building
    and maintaining systems of the complexity called for by the
    tasks we attempt. just as high level languages enabled the
    programmer to escape from the intricacies of a machine's order
    code, higher level programming systems can provide the means to
    understand and manipulate complex systems and components. in
    order to develop such systems, we need to shift our attention
    away from the detailed specification of algorithms, towards the
    description of the properties of the packages and objects with
    which we build. this paper analyzes some of the shortcomings of
    programming languages as they now exist, and lays out some
    possible directions for future research. july, 1979 winograd,

    a mobile library service is only likely to have to cater for
    ethnic minorities in urban areas. after the local ethnic
    minorities have been identified a reasonable stock of books in
    the appropriate languages must be included bearing in mind that
    several ethnic minorities are english-speaking e.g. west
    indians. stocks of books for ethnic minorities must perforce be
    limited since ethnic minorities also read books originating
    from the dominant culture' a surfeit would also alienate the

    <text>remarks on the practical solution of characteristic value
    problems this paper is concerned with the practical solution of
    characteristic value problem for an ordinary differential
    equation. it is at once apparent that sequential computers, be
    they digital or analog, solve initial value problems, rather
    than boundary value problems, and some mathematical process
    must be found to compensate for the machine's inadequacy.
    (compensating for machine imperfection is, of course, the
    normal activity of the numerical analyst.) a number of other
    papers have applied particular devices to particular problems.
    the purpose of this note is to establish a mathematical
    framework or model for these practical procedures and thus
    assist in the use and extension of the ideas in other
    particular problems. june, 1959 wouk, a. ca590606 jb march 22,

    theory and practice of librarianship in the soviet union has
    always attracted special attention. although the educational
    role of citatel' has been emphasised as the most important one,
    there has always been enough space on its pages to advise
    librarians of improvement in working conditions, and to
    campaign for the establishment of new libraries. today,
    citatel' is well established not only in czechoslovakia, but it
    also has a good reputation abroad, and interest in it is on the

    aimed at the smaller publisher and its purpose was to provide a
    practical introduction to some of the legal and financial
    aspects of book publishing. copyright, contracts and the
    pricing of publications were areas which were given particular
    attention, and in the discussion periods following each paper
    there were opportunities to widen the scope and to raise
    problems of a very practical nature; in a concluding paper some

    <text>multidimensional binary search trees used for associative
    searching this paper develops the multidimensional binary
    search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the
    search space) as a data structure for storage of information to
    be retrieved by associative searches. the k-d tree is defined
    and examples are given. it is shown to be quite in its storage
    requirements. a significant advantage of this structure is that
    a single data structure can handle many types of queries very
    efficiently. various utility algorithms are developed; their
    proven average running times in an n record file are:
    insertion, o (log n); deletion of the root, o (n^(k-1)/k);
    deletion of a random node, o (log n); and optimization
    (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), o (n log n).
    search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t
    keys specified [proven maximum running time of o (n^(k-t)/k)]
    and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average
    running time of o (log n).] these performances far surpass the
    best currently known algorithms for these tasks. an algorithm
    is presented to handle any general intersection query. the main
    focus of this paper theoretical. it is felt, however, that k-d
    trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples
    of potential uses are given. september, 1975 bently, j. l.

    against lists and possible alternatives to them. production of
    these lists is expensive and time consuming; each library must
    decide for itself whether it is worth producing them. if better
    use is to be made of the lists, more attention must be paid to
    the selection of material and target groups. in future,
    specific subject lists including non-commercial works will

    <text>scalar- and planar- valued curve fitting using splines
    under tension the spline under tension was introduced by
    schweikert in an attempt to imitate cubic splines but avoid the

    are presented here, together with an efficient method for
    determining the necessary parameters and computing the
    resultant spline. the standard scalar-valued curve fitting
    problem is discussed, as well as the fitting of open and closed
    curves in the plane. the use of these curves and the importance
    of the tension in the fitting of contour lines are mentioned as

    was to study the organisation of public patent libraries and on
    this basis (supplemented with interviews with experts) to draft
    recommendations for the improvement of access to material in
    such libraries. the patent offices of west germany and france,
    european patent office, science reference library in london,
    and patent libraries or information centres in nuremberg,
    liverpool, lyon, strasbourg, and toulouse were visited. the
    most important problem areas identified were identification of

    <text>fair play with the cake, you know?'.d iscusses the
    economic cuts as they affect the library services. the
    government's savings circular recommended that local
    authorities cut library expenditure to 185 kr per capita, as,
    it was argued, public libraries showed signs of uncontrolled
    growth. the librarians' union has, however, calculated public
    libraries' real growth in 1980 as within the government's
    recommended 3%; this is supported by the library inspectorate.
    the figures for 1981 indicate an average fall in real growth of
    1.4%. the librarians' union has examined the local effects of
    cuts and found that fringe services like outreach activities
    are worst hit and that staff appointments are frozen. the
    government's technocrats have drawn up models for the
    development of the public sector, but librarians' answer must
    be that the development of the library part of this sector is
    not a technical matter only, but that cultural aspects are
    equally important.</text>

    perspective. the appropriateness of instruction mixes, kernels,
    simulators, and other tools is discussed, as well as pitfalls
    which may be encountered when using them. analysis, simulation,

    <text>origin of the f layer the splitting of the f layer into
    the f and f layers is considered to be be due to a thermal
    effect the maximum temperature occurs in the region of maximum
    ion production but since the density of gas in this region is a
    minimum higher electron concentrations will occur above and
    below it the region of maximum ionization lies in the lower
    half of the f layer and hence the f layer will be thinner than
    the f layer the formula derived for the height distribution of
    the electron concentration shows that the thermal process could

    <text>the cray-1 computer system this paper describes the

    its manufacture. the cray-1 is the only computer to have been
    built to date that satisfies erda's class vi requirement (a
    computer capable of processing from 20 to 60 million floating
    point operations per second) [1]. the cray-1's fortran compiler
    (cft) is designed to give the scientific user immediate access
    to the benefits of the cray-1's vector processing architecture.
    an optimizing compiler, cft, "vectorizes" innermost do loops.
    compatible with the ansi 1966 fortran standard and with many
    commonly supported fortran extensions, cft does not require any
    source program modifications or the use of additional
    nonstandard fortran statements to achieve vectorization. thus
    the user's investment of hundreds of man months of effort to
    develop fortran programs for other contemporary computers is

    <text>faculty status for librarians in the rocky mountain

    region reveal that 62 of the schools grant some of their
    librarians faculty status, and that 40 grant faculty status to
    all librarians. the greatest discrepancy in benefits received
    by teaching and library faculty arises in length of contract
    year and publishing responsibilities. directors of only 12 of
    the 40 libraries note controversy over faculty status for
    librarians, yet comments on the questionnaire and the results
    themselves suggest otherwise. also, respondents' uncertainty

    <text>a note on linear programming algorithm design: a
    combinatorial problem as linear programming models grow bigger
    and bigger in size, much actual data that must be memorized is
    often put on magnetic tape or disk, and consequently there is
    an improportionality fast rise in the consumption of computer
    time.to cut down this expense, an ever increasing effort is
    made to design more efficient algorithms. this paper is meant
    to support the effort. it is attempted to find some
    characteristics of the way a pivot column is found. the number
    of repetitions of a certain transfer of data from tape to core
    memory is considered. after some simplification, the problem is
    restated in a general way. the generating function of the
    probability distribution and the moment generating function of
    the number of repetitions is found. asymptotic formulas are
    given for the moments using a result from a paper of s. narumi
    [1]. the results may be applied to write very efficient
    routines that search for an extreme value in a table. formulas
    provide a means of calculating the computer timings in this
    case. may, 1966 roes, p. b. m. ca660504 jb march 3, 1978 10:10

    multiple-data stream machine, dedicated to associative file
    searching while overall control of the system would be
    entrusted to a conventional single-instruction single-data

    over 2 orders of magnitude, be simple to maintain, and offer

    artificial intelligence. it is important to choose a class of
    signals which is, at present, undergoing a good deal of visual
    inspection by trained people for the purpose of pattern
    recognition. in this way comparisons between machine and human
    performance may be obtained. a practical result also serves as
    additional motivation. clinical electrocardiograms make up such
    a class of signals. the approach to the problem presented here
    centers upon the use of multiple adaptive matched filters that
    classify normalized signals. the present report fives some of
    the background for the application of this method. october,

    <text>coko iii: the cooper-koz chess program coko iii is a
    chess player written entirely in fortran. on the ibm 360-65,
    coko iii plays a minimal chess game at the rate of .2 sec cpu
    time per move, with a level close to lower chess club play. a
    selective tree searching procedure controlled by tactical chess
    logistics allows a deployment of multiple minimal game
    calculations to achieve some optimal move selection. the tree
    searching algorithms are the heart of coko's effectiveness, yet
    they are conceptually simple. in addition, an interesting
    phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued
    coko's entire development just as it troubles a human player.
    standard exponential growth is curbed to a large extent by the
    definition and trimming of the fischer set. a clear distinction
    between tree pruning and selective tree searching is also made.
    representation of the chess environment is described along with
    a strategical preanalysis procedure that maps the lasker
    regions. specific chess algorithms are described which could be
    used as a command structure by anyone desiring to do some chess
    program experimentation. a comparison is made of some
    mysterious actions of human players and coko iii. july, 1973

    <text>deciding the future of the catalog in small libraries. in
    jan 81, the library of congress closed its card catalogue and
    adopted aacr 2 (the anglo-american cataloguing rules, 2nd
    edition). now, every us library must decide upon the future of
    its catalogue in the face of these decisions. each must decide
    whether or not to use aacr 2, and if so, when to implement it.
    presents a checklist which will aid the library in its
    planning, with a brief bibliography of items relating to the
    future of the catalogue vis-a-vis the new code.</text>

    <text>information for agro-industry. a paper presented at the
    1981 interamerican conference of agricultural librarians and
    documentalists. brazil, like other latin american countries, is
    looking for alternative energy supplies, derived from natural
    resources, exploited by agro-industrial processes. considers
    the role of information and documentation services in
    supporting the development of this field, describing the kind
    of research institutions involved and the services required.
    presents a model for organising an information and
    documentation service within a research institution, with
    details of the activities essential for information
    acquisition, processing and dissemination; user services; and
    support services for the parent institution; showing how the
    structure can be modified for internal and external users. in
    conclusion, emphasises that agro-industrial information is a
    new field with its own special characteristics.</text>
