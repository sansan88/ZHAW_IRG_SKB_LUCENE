    <text>the 3rd international meeting of experts from national
    libraries of socialist countries on acquisitions and
    international book exchange (budapest, 2-6 october 1979). the
    main topics discussed at the 3rd meeting were' the
    international exchange of publications and the design of a
    model of the copyright law. although a system of duplicates
    exchange has now been established and the exchange of
    microfilms has increased, 1 area of exchanges not yet
    functioning smoothly is official publications. a more unified
    approach will have to be developed before the system can become
    fully effective. the working group set up to investigate the
    position of the copyright deposit presented their
    recommendation to produce a model of the copyright deposit law
    for socialist countries as the model produced by the ifla's
    section on national libraries does not suit the conditions of
    multinational and federal countries and socialist countries in
    general.</text>

    <text>public libraries and adult education associations in
    cooperation. the adult education movement built up libraries at
    the beginning of the 20th century, but when these were
    transferred to the municipal libraries, the connection between
    the organisations and libraries largely ceased. conscious of
    this, orebro regional library in conjunction with 4 public
    libraries and 4 adult education associations drew up a project
    supported by the cultural council for an experimental period of
    1 year, with a part-time librarian as organiser. the aim was to
    establish contact with the leaders, examine the associations'
    needs and how the library could meet them. direct contact with
    the class leaders proved difficult and advance notice of books
    needed hard to obtain. study visits to the library were made by
    some groups, and special and background literature was lent to
    the groups on long loans. concludes that the libraries often
    lacked staff and time to take the necessary initiatives, and
    that the study grou p leader is the key to any fruitful
    contact.</text>

    <text>language analysis in the humanities the use of the
    computer in the language-oriented humanities for exhaustive
    listing of detail (as in indices and concordances) is
    widespread and accepted as desirable. the implications of the
    computer for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
    gathering data for the construction and testing of models-are
    neither widely recognized nor accepted. this paper argues that
    the computer's major role as to language analysis in the
    humanities will be the establishing of such a science.thus, for
    those areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision are
    necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching a student to
    write a composition) the computer can be a critically important
    facilitator. july, 1972 sedelow, s. y. language analysis,

    <text>common phrases and minimum-space text storage a method
    for saving storage space for text strings, such as compiler
    diagnostic messages, is described. the method relies on hand
    selection of a set of text strings which are common to one or
    more messages. these phrases are then stored only once. the
    storage technique gives rise to a mathematical optimization
    problem: determine how each message should use the available
    phrases to minimize its storage requirement. this problem is
    nontrivial when phrases which overlap exist. however, a dynamic
    programming algorithm is presented which solves the problem in
    time which grows linearly with the number of characters in the
    text. algorithm 444 applies to this paper. march, 1973 wagner,

    <text>public library services in friesland. the 1st public
    library financed from local authority sources in the province
    of friesland in the netherlands was founded at leeuwaarden in
    1905. in the years following, libraries were founded in the
    other large towns of the province, whilst in the smaller
    communities libraries staffed with unpaid volunteers were
    formed, often with the support of the local church authorities.
    following the formation in 1917 of the vereniging voor openbaar
    leeszaalwezen in friesland (association of public reading rooms
    in friesland) a regular delivery of book boxes was organised by
    the town libraries for the local community libraries.
    throughout the province there are now some 180,000 registered
    public library users, representing more than 30% of the
    population, and loans total some 8 million annually.</text>

    <text>journals in libraries. there have always been problems
    connected with journal collections in libraries. collections
    were often incomplete, unsuitably stored and often impossible
    to locate owing to incomplete cataloguing. 1 improvement was
    the introduction of microfilm which was easier to store and
    meant that original journal copies could be stored in the
    archives and not damaged by continual use. the association of
    german librarians' commission for journals has published
    important material dealing with the best ways of storing and
    cataloguing journal collections and cooperative filming with
    other libraries. an important aid to locating journals is gerd
    hagelweide's location catalogue deutsche zeitungsbestande in
    bibliotheken und archiven (german journal collections in
    libraries and archives). the publication of regional journal
    catalogues in westphalia, berlin, hesse and wurtemberg has

    periodicals held by the university of ulm. while in the period
    1976-80 an average price increase of 5% was recorded, after
    preliminary investigations the increase rate for 1981 seems to
    be much higher compared with 1980; the average rise for 85
    periodicals appears to be about 21%. special attention was paid
    to literature documentation services which are relatively
    expensive to print. from 11 information services investigated
    the price increase during 1976-80 was about 8.2% per year;
    their price rise for 1981 has been announced as 13.2%. the

    groups' theoretical fundamental principles of bibliography;
    organisation of bibliographical literature information and
    methods of bibliographical activity; historic development of
    bibliography; present level of general bibliography; present
    level of scientific bibliography; present level of
    recommendatory bibliography in east germany and ussr; and the
    bibliography of bibliography. these 7 themes are closely linked
    and intersect in many areas especially in the case of the
    bibliography of bibliography, which often accompanies other
    themes. the course in bibliography is a balanced mixture of
    theory and practice. it is important that students should be
    educated to the advanced level of bibliography as it exists in
    east germany and ussr. the time allotted to the course is not
    adequate and students have to study independen tly which
    requires a good knowledge of languages as much of the course

    <text>alternatives for future library catalogs' a cost model'
    final report of the library catalog cost model project prepared
    for the association of research libraries. under arl
    sponsorship, king research, inc., developed a library catalog
    cost model to assist 72 participating libraries in comparing
    the cost of alternative future forms of catalogue, emphasising
    the cost of implementing aacr2. 68 libraries prepared inputs
    characterising their costs and modes of operation, and these
    were used, with the model, to compute costs of alternative
    catalogue forms. inputs and outputs of the model were highly
    variable. costs of implementing aacr2 were estimated to be 4-7%
    of the total cost of developing and maintaining a catalogue.
    the model can be a useful planning, budgeting and staffing
    tool, and may be seen as a prototype, adaptable to project
    costs of other library operations, especially acquisitions.
    recommendations are made for future model development.</text>

    <text>on the normalization requirement of divisor in divide-
    and- correct methods this paper presents an analysis on the
    normalization requirement of the divisor in a
    divide-and-correct method. this analysis is made subject to the
    condition that not more than one correction is required to
    obtain the true quotient character, from the trial estimate got
    from the division of a two-precision segment of every partial
    remainder by a suitably rounded single-precision divisor. (this
    segmented division is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic
    division.) it is found that the normalization requirement could
    be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors, provided the
    magnitude of the character next to the leading character of the
    divisor is known. if, however, the normalization is to be
    eliminated one has to choose proper higher precision segments
    of operands for the basic division. also considered is the
    possibility of eliminating the normalization by an increase on
    the number of corrections on the quotient estimate got from a
    (2, 1) precision basic division. it is shown that such a scheme
    is economical only for small radices. december, 1967

    <text>serials departments' doomed to extinction?. because tasks
    and materials related to serials processing and use are often
    dispersed in a library, serials specialists must develop
    personal influence strategies and use informal communications
    systems which cross organisational boundaries. in the absence
    of a serials department, serials specialists and informal
    serials communication systems will continue to exist. it is
    widely agreed that informal communication systems emerge
    spontaneously in organisations and individuals with no formally
    conferred authority may use various types of personal influence
    strategies to achieve organisational objectives. while serials
    processing and public service could be most efficiently handled
    through a serials department, informal communication systems,
    utilised by serials specialists, will develop if such a
    department does not exist. in determining if a serials
    department has a place in a particular library organisation,
    library planners should be concerned a bout natural
    communication channels and should try to identify individuals
    who can communicate effectively across organisational
    barriers.</text>

    <text>computer technology in communist china, 1956-1965 based
    on information from translations of communist chinese news
    items and periodical literature for the 1965 period, computer
    technology in china is reviewed under the following headings:
    (1) initial planning, organization and educational aspects of
    computer technology and automation; (2) machine development
    progress: two major specific machines in 1958-59, with soviet
    aid; a vacuum in 1960-64 due to the withdrawal of soviet aid;
    then presumably all-chinese-made machines from 1965 to the
    present; (3) computer applications; (4) the trend of
    automation: control of production processes rather than data
    processing; and (5) the "yun ch'ou hsueh" (science of operation
    and programming) campaign of 1958-60, during which an attempt
    was made to bring concepts such as linear programming to
    ordinary chinese workers and peasants. communist china is
    adjudged to have a marginal computer capability, with most of
    its machines probably being of a binary nature; however, a
    turning point may have been reached in mid-1965. september,

    <text>a profile of the programmer synopsis: 549 members of the
    acm participated in a study concerned primarily with the
    attitudes of programmers toward their careers and jobs. a very
    high percentage of programmers have apparently entered their
    careers by accident; it has proven a happy choice for most and
    they expect to remain in the field during the next five years.
    their principal job satisfactions relate to the nature of their
    work, and mostfind their jobs offer high level of professional
    interest and good working conditions. salary and advancement
    prospects, however,are not as satisfactory. more than half
    report a positive attitude toward programmers and programming
    on the part of their organizations. turnover among themselves
    is attributed primarily to poor management-salary is seen as
    the principal motivating factor in turnover among other
    programmers. nature of the work offered and salary are
    principal determinants in accepting a new job. programmers are
    less mobile than expected. programmers tend to see their
    colleagues in a favorable light, on the whole. personalities
    seem to vary with function, systems programmers differing from
    applications programmers. four principal problems for
    programming in the immediate future are listed by participants:
    languages, personnel, various specific applications and
    techniques, and building programming as a profession. october,

    <text>unimarc. several agencies that were formerly satisfied by
    single conversions from another format are beginning to require
    data from multiple agencies. either multiple conversions must
    be written or a switch to unimarc could take place. the cost
    savings with unimarc are obvious. multiple conversions
    programmes represent a high initial investment and a tremendous
    problem in keeping up with all of the changes to necessarily
    dynamic national formats. the introduction of aacr2 and
    resultant national format changes are at this time causing
    several agencies to rewrite conversion programmes. a major
    obstacle to a truly international unimarc exchange is that the
    change takes a joint commitment since an agency's ability to
    receive unimarc records is useless if the sending agency cannot
    send them. ifla and its members need to undertake a major

    <text>is a fitted carpet harmful to allergic people?. fitted
    carpets have become popular in libraries because they cut down
    noise. but if carpets are not kept clean and rooms well
    ventilated they can cause problems for people suffering from
    respiratory ailments. new carpets do not cause this trouble.
    research in sweden and finland shows that carpets stay dirty

    <text>the ethics of further education librarianship. the
    librarian's 'clients' in the further education sector are
    identified. his duties towards them and the problems raised by
    them are discussed, with special reference to the education of
    the 16-19 age group. the need for the librarian to hold their
    diverse and sometimes conflicting demands in balance is seen as
    an aspect of his duties that requires professional autonomy for
    its satisfactory performance. the need for a balanced use of
    the facilities, coverage of subject areas, provision for
    divergent views, and encouragement of free enquiry leads to the
    suggestion that treatment rather than ideas is what the
    librarian is best qualified to assess. pornography is discussed
    in relation to this and other criteria. the growth of open
    learning is seen as demanding a positive tutorial approach. the
    need for moral courage is affirmed.</text>

    the number of titles processed is then related to the

    <text>growing applications of linear programming use of linear
    programming models has grown so extensively in recent years
    that the whole concept for organizing a computer code has
    undergone a radical change. it no longer is adequate merely to
    reduce a mathematical algorithm (i.e. the simplex method) to a
    computer code. an advanced code must cope with such a variety
    of situations that the respective computer subprograms must be
    organized into an integrated system. emphasis in this paper is
    devoted to the underlying principles upon which future linear
    programming systems must be based. these viewpoints are
    influenced by the new demands that applications within the
    petroleum industry are placing on such systems. some of the
    components of such a system are: translation of problem
    statement in terms of basic data to linear programming matrix
    coefficients, data transmission for direct computer entry, data
    file at the computer center, data processing and editing prior
    to solving the simplex algorithm, an efficient and reliable
    code for solving the above-mentioned algorithm, and flexible
    means for summarizing the results. june, 1964 aronofsky, j. s.

    <text>improving programs by the introduction of recursion a new
    technique of program transformation, called "recursion in
    troduction," is described and applied to two algorithms which
    solve pattern matching problems. by using recursion in
    troduction, algorithms which manipulate a stack are first
    translated into recursive algorithms in which no stack
    operations occur. these algorithms are then subjected to a
    second transformation, a method of recursion elimination called
    "tabulation," to produce programs with a very efficient running
    time. in particular, it is shown how the fast linear pattern
    matching algorithm of knuth, morris, and pratt can be derived
    in a few steps from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm.

    <text>use of decision tables in computer programming a decision
    table is a tabular form for displaying decision logic. decision
    tables have many inherent advantages. the technique to be
    illustrated puts these advantages to use in that it enables one
    to program directly from a decision table. the technique is
    based on the creation of a binary image of a limited entry
    decision table in computer memory. a binary image of a given
    set of input conditions can also be created. this data image is
    used to scan the decision table image to arrive at the proper
    course of action. there are several advantages gained from the
    programming point view: (1) amount of computer memory used is
    drastically reduced, (2) programming is simplified, and (3)
    documentation is brief and clear. january, 1965 kirk, h. w.

    <text>a practical method for constructing lr(k) processors a
    practical method for constructing lr(k) processors is
    developed. these processors are capable of recognizing and
    parsing an input during a single no-backup scan in a number of
    steps equal to the length of the input plus the number of steps
    in its derivation. the technique presented here is based on the
    original method described by knuth, but decreases both the
    effort required to construct the processor and the size of the
    processor produced. this procedure involves partitioning the
    given grammar into a number of smaller parts. if an lr(k)
    processor can be constructed for each part (using knuth's
    algorithm) and if certain conditions relating these individual
    processors are satisfied, then an lr(k) processor for the
    entire grammar can be constructed for them. using this
    procedure, an lr(1) parser for algol has been obtained.

    librarian is a librarian 1st in the uk, a teacher 1st in

    spend time on in-service programmes designed to give ideas on

    <text>for american librarians trade unions are not a great
    attraction. interviews marion porro, president of the trade
    union for library employees in new york. the organisation of
    library employees in the usa has not been very successful and
    today only about 10% of employees, mostly in the large urban
    public libraries, are union members. this is, however, in line
    with the general scepticism towards the trade union movement
    among americans in general and the professions in particular.
    the ala has on the whole had an ambiguous attitude to trade
    union matters. the trade union in new york, the new york
    library guild, or local 1930, established in 1968, has about
    1500 members and almost total coverage. it negotiates 2 yearly
    agreements on pay and conditions and deals with grievances, but
    does not participate in the library professional
    decision-making. on a wider front, the union is engaged in
    various social protest movements, but no cooperation with other
    trade unions for library employees takes pl ace.</text>

    <text>parallel methods for integrating ordinary differential

    order to take full advantage for real-time computations of
    highly parallel computers as can be expected to be available in
    the near future, much of numerical analysis will have to be
    recast in a more "parallel" form. by this is meant that serial
    algorithms ought to be replaced by algorithm which consist of
    several subtasks which can be computed without knowledge of the
    results of the other subtasks. as an example, a method is
    proposed for "parallelizing" the numerical integration of an
    ordinary differential equation, which process, by all standard
    methods, is entirely serial. december, 1964 nievergelt, j.

    <text>libraries as municipal information centres; the danish
    experience. talk given to the 14th nordic library meeting held
    in stockholm aug 80. the danish local authority reforms of 1970
    and the local authority planning act of 1977, which extended
    the democratic principle, intensified the demand for a more
    efficient public information service. to satisfy this demand
    the state information office for distribution of government
    information was set up in 1977 and cooperation with libraries
    established. the report on 'local participatory democracy'
    stimulated the development of public information services in
    libraries. the 'kommune-information' at the town library of
    lyngby-taarbaek was set up in 1977. it is placed close to the
    reference room and staffed by 1 full-time librarian. close
    cooperation with the town hall exists and contact persons in
    each department were appointed. all material automatically sent
    to kommune-information is catalogued and displayed and some may
    be borrowed. an informatio n index of local items is being
    built up. around 400 enquiries a month are dealt with, some by
    reference to the relevant department, others directly,
    concerning' decisions made, rights and duties, on-going
    projects, local groups and societies. despite the need few

    <text>extending the information theory approach to converting
    limited-entry decision tables to computer programs this paper
    modifies an earlier algorithm for converting decision tables
    into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when
    compiled into a computer program. the algorithms considered in
    this paper perform limited search and, accordingly, do not
    necessarily result in globally optimal solutions. however, the
    greater search effort needed to obtain a globally optimal
    solution for complex decision tables is usually not justified
    by sufficient savings in execution time. there is an analogy
    between the problem of converting decision tables into
    efficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem in
    information theory of noiseless coding. the results of the
    noiseless coding literature are used to explore the limitations
    of algorithms used to solve the decision table problem. the
    analogy between the two problems is also used to develop
    improvements to the information algorithm in extending the
    depth of search under certain conditions and in proposing
    additional conditions to be added to the decision table.
    finally, the information algorithm is compared with an
    algorithm proposed in a recent paper by verhelst. september,

    <text>regional cooperation' some practical developments. paper
    presented to a meeting of the working party on provincial
    central libraries in deventer, 19 nov 81. in the netherlands
    the cutbacks in local government finances together with the
    growing demand on libraries for technical information have
    encouraged public libraries to cooperate with one another on a
    regional basis to improve the quality and efficiency of their
    services. in addition the expectation that the existing network
    of libraries charged with a regional support function will be
    increased, and the decentralisation of local government
    services as proposed in the new public services act, will
    further encourage this trend. however, where libraries enter
    into schemes of cooperation the needs of their readers should
    remain the prime consideration.</text>

    <text>plexus-an on-line system for modeling neural networks a
    description is presented of plexus, a system which enables a

    output data produced by the network, and to store and retrieve
    networks and data from a library. the system, operated entirely
    from a digital display unit, interacts directly with the user
    and permits easy and rapid transitions between the various
    phases of the modeling process. plexus is designed to
    complement neurophysiological research so that the systematic
    development of neural models can be coordinated with
    experimental work. plexus networks are built up from components
    representing individual neurons, external stimuli, and
    interconnecting fibers, each component being of a relatively
    detailed nature. provision is also made for the use of
    experimental data as input to a network. convenient means for
    specification and modification of a network and extensive
    error-checking capabilities are provided. data resulting from
    the simulation of a network may be analyzed by a variety of
    techniques ranging from examinations of the gross
    characteristics of the data to the determination of detailed
    statistical properties. september, 1968 dill, j. c. randall, d.

    envisaged including several district cultural centres as well
    as the necessary structural changes. in-service courses for
    information scientists must be offered on a larger scale than
    before and the cooperation of scientific libraries with their
    counterparts in socialist countries should be strengthened.
    young people should be helped by school libraries which ought
    to be fully integrated into the whole educational process
    starting at primary schools. manual workers, labourers and
    young apprentices can be attracted to trade union libraries by
    a great variety of library games, quizes and competitions.
    information workers are encouraged to play a more active role

    <text>characteristics of program localities the term "locality"
    has been used to denote that subset of a program's segments
    which are referenced during a particular phase of its
    execution. a program's behavior can be characterized in terms
    of its residence in localities of various sizes and lifetimes,
    and the transitions between these localities. in this paper the
    concept of a locality is made more explicit through a formal
    definition of what constitutes a phase of localized reference
    behavior, and by a corresponding mechanism for the detection of
    localities in actual reference strings. this definition
    provides for the existence of a hierarchy of localities at any
    given time, and the reasonableness of the definition is
    supported by examples taken from actual programs. empirical
    data from a sample of production algol 60 programs is used to
    display distributions of locality sizes and lifetimes, and
    these results are discussed in terms of their implications for
    the modeling of program behavior and memory management in
    virtual memory systems. may, 1976 madison, a. w. batson, a. p.

    of merging productions. the productions generated correspond to
    the minimum cost inverse-arborescence of that graph. the
    validity of the technique is demonstrated for weak precedence
    grammars defined here, but the productions mechanically
    generated for any precedence grammar can often be modified in

    <text>library automation in australia' the state of the art.
    both the 14.5 million population and the distance which
    australia is from the major publishing centres may account for
    the enthusiasm for new technology. australian libraries were
    early users of microcomputers. a growth in the country's
    telecommunications has culminated in the introduction of midas
    in 79, and use of on-line data bases via lockheed, sdc and
    oclc. access to data bases within australia is now achieved
    through ausinet and csironet. this has promoted library
    automation, dealt with here in 3 phases' (1) relates to
    punched-card systems; (2) is characterised by the introduction
    of ausmarc in 71, and the australian marc record service; and
    (3) covers the shared systems and cooperative networks. briefly
    surveys the future which seems largely dependent on the success
    of the national library of australia's development programme
    for hardware and software to provide a nationwide

    <text>here the librarian donates her salary to the library. a
    talk given to the 14th nordic library meeting on the theme'
    part-time libraries today and tomorrow. with a definition of
    part-time libraries as those open only a few hours a week,
    iceland has only 15 full-time libraries out of 250; 25 of 40
    central libraries are part-time. with 60% of the population
    living in the reykjavik region and the rest scattered in small
    local authorities, it is not economically possible to have a
    library service which fulfils ifla norms. the library act of
    1976 made local authorities financially responsible for
    libraries. many, therefore, combined school and public
    libraries, as education receives state support. most libraries
    charge fees for borrowing and most librarians are unqualified.
    the solution lies in reducing the number of central libraries
    to 8; these should be run by the state and have mobile
    libraries. local libraries should also be fewer. training for
    part-time librarians with proper salary condi tions should be
    initiated.</text>

    <text>numerical analysis in a ph.d. computer science program
    numerical analysis is the study of methods and procedures used
    to obtain "approximate solutions" to mathematical problems.
    much of the emphasis is on scientific calculation. the
    difficulties of education in such a broad area center around
    the question of background and emphasis. the numerical analysis
    program in the computer science department should emphasize an
    awareness of the problems of computer implementation and
    experimental procedures. nevertheless, there is a need for a
    solid background in applied mathematics. december, 1969 parter,

    <text>capability-based addressing various addressing schemes
    making use of segment tables are examined. the inadequacies of
    these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are explained.
    these inadequacies are traced to the lack of an efficient
    absolute address for objects in these systems. the direct use
    of a capability as an address is shown to overcome these
    difficulties because it provides the needed absolute address.
    implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed. it
    is predicted that the use of tags to identify capabilities will
    dominate. a hardware address translation scheme which never
    requires the modification of the representation of capabilities
    is suggested. the scheme uses a main memory hash table for
    obtaining a segment's location in main memory given its unique
    code. the hash table is avoided for recently accessed segments
    by means of a set of associative registers. a computer using
    capability-based addressing may be substantially superior to
    present systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of
    programming conventions, and efficient implementation. july,

    lombardy, begun in 1975 and disrupted in 1977. details are
    given of the structure of the system drawn up by the regional
    administration, the organisation and operation of existing
    libraries as information and cataloguing centres, and the
    technical equipment introduced. with the change of government
    in 1977, the project was suspended for re-evaluation, and up to
    1980 no decision had been reached. the inherent defects of the
    system are analysed, to show how the regional administration
    made a fundamental error in establishing a decentralised system
    without overhauling existing services to ensure adequate
    cooperation between cataloguing centres. the immediate causes
    of suspension were incompatability of the automated system
    chosen with marc, and failure of individual libraries to
    maintain routine cataloguing activities. emph asises the

    (population served, total book-stock, circulation, number of
    full-time staff, and operating expenditure). this profile

    <text>the cataloguing of music manuscripts in old bavaria and

    bavarian libraries acquired many music manuscripts, mainly of
    choral and instrumental works from about 1750 onwards. since
    1958 renewed efforts at cataloguing have been made, with help,
    since 1964, from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german
    research association) and the bavarian state library. since
    1971 3 catalogue sections have been published and others are in
    course of preparation. the catalogues are important since this
    type of music is rarely found in public collections; brief
    biographies of little-known composers are included. the
    collection also includes early works by well-known composers
    such as mozart and michael haydn. 3 collections owned by noble

    <text>least squares fitting of planes to surfaces using dynamic
    programming dynamic programming has recently been used by
    stone, by bellman and by gluss to determine the closet fit of
    broken line segments to a curve in an interval under the
    constraint that the number of segments is fixed. in the present
    paper successive models are developed to extend the method to
    the fitting of broken plane segments to surfaces z=g(x,y)
    defined over certain types of subareas of the (x,y)-space. the
    first model considers a rectangular area, with the constraint
    that the plane segments are defined over a grid in the
    (x,y)-space. it is then shown how this model may be
    incorporated into an algorithm that provides successive
    approximations to optimal fits for any type of closed area.
    finally, applications are briefly described. april, 1963 gluss,

    economic, social and cultural policies which have to be

    a disciplined and responsible way. librarians must use a
    systematic and personal approach and deal with the class
    struggle, the role of the ussr in the world, the general

    <text>public protection and education with eft research has
    revealed the existence of widespread misinformation and lack of
    knowledge about eft among business and government as well as
    consumers. as a result, any effort to stimulate meaningful
    public participation in decisions on the introduction of eft
    systems will require a coordinated educational effort of
    considerable scale. in addition, research has revealed
    shortcomings in the present system for defining
    responsibilities, liabilities, and avenues of recourse. this
    article presents several possible alternatives for improving
    the current system, but ongoing research is also needed to
    assure that actions taken will be responsive to the changing

    <text>a computer system for transformational grammar a
    comprehensive system for transformational grammar has been
    designed and implemented on the ibm 360/67 computer. the system
    deals with the transformational model of syntax, along the
    lines of chomsky's aspects of the theory of syntax. the major
    innovations include a full,formal description of the syntax of
    a transformational grammar, a directed random phrase structure
    generator, a lexical insertion algorithm, an extended
    definition of analysis, and a simple problem-oriented
    programming language in which the algorithm for application of
    transformations can be expressed. in this paper we present the
    system as a whole, first discussing the general attitudes
    underlying the development of the system, then outlining the
    system and discussing its more important special features.
    references are given to papers which consider some particular
    aspect of the system in detail. june, 1969 friedman, j.

    instead of defending what is culturally valuable, librarians
    give in to popular demand in order to achieve high loan
    figures. the relationship between the library service's reviews
    and library purchases demonstrates this' well reviewed quality
    books are bought in small numbers, whereas multiple copies are

    acceptance of books as gifts from publishers, institutions and
    private individuals. walter scharf, who succeeded her in 1958,

    their catalogues on bibliographies published by the book trade
    such as exhibition catalogues. these were often incomplete and
    did not include reprints or new editions. there are many
    examples of incorrect references in the catalogues and a

    <text>pose: a language for posing problems to a computer a
    language, pose, is described which is a drastic departure from

    and logic representations (and actually contains fortran vi as
    a subset). with the new language, the user need only describe
    his problem in "equation-like" form. the method of solution is
    automatically provided in conjunction with the translation from
    equation form to computer instruction. in this way the pose
    language user can solve difficult computational problems (like
    the solution of differential equation) without requiring a
    knowledge of numerical methods or the intricacies of computer
    subroutine logic. essentially all clerical operations now
    required for fortran programming have been automated so that
    the pose programmer need not be concerned with these details.

    <text>a selective traversal algorithm for binary search trees
    the problem of selecting data items from a binary search tree
    according to a list of range conditions is considered. the
    process of visiting a minimal number of nodes to retrieve data
    satisfying the range conditions is called selective traversal.
    presented in this paper is an algorithm for selective traversal
    which uses a tag field for each node in the tree. the algorithm
    is particularly useful and efficient when examination of data
    is more time consuming than examination of a tag field. june,

    <text>a view from barbados. contribution to a section devoted

    interlending in barbados is assisted by the close proximity of

    international requests are routed via the university of west
    indies library to the blld for journals, but to a wider
    selection of libraries for monographs. the choice is difficult
    and time-consuming for monograph requests, and automated union
    catalogues produced in other countries could help in this
    respect. small collections of periodicals satisfy a high

    is also impossible to improve the journal's layout, although
    the printing facilities at the cyril and methodius national
    library are gratefully appreciated. certain suggestions should
    improve 2bibliotekar's 1quality and image, e.g. articles should
    be planned well in advance by the cyril and methodius national
    library and other major libraries. freelance correspondents all
    over the country should report regularly about libraries in
    their regions. other freelance collaborators, with a good
    command of modern languages, should provide reviews of foreign
    periodicals on librarianship and designate articles worthy of
    full translation into bulgarian. a special commission should be

    in a finite number of steps. the algorithm consists of
    factoring single-variable instances of the given polynomial by
    kronecker's method and introducing the remaining variables by
    interpolation. techniques for implementing the algorithm and
    several examples are discussed. the algorithm promises
    sufficient power to be used efficiently in an online system for

    <text>registration-identification of crystalline materials
    based on lattice and empirical formula. data files containing
    information on solid-state materials are expanding rapidly.
    each year several thousand new materials are characterised by
    x-ray diffraction techniques. consequently, computer procedures
    have been developed to register materials entering large data
    files. registration based on lattice parameters and empirical
    formula is especially effective. the lattice is uniquely
    represented by the reduced cell and the elements in the formula
    are uniquely specified by prime numbers. this method has been
    applied for several years to register new materials for the
    cambridge crystallographic data file which contains data on
    more than 25,000 compounds containing organic carbon. the
    method is now being adapted to register materials for the nbs

    <text>are mobile libraries a profitable means of providing
    literature for structurally weak areas?. literature provision
    for rural areas has always been difficult. a comparison between
    mobile and small village libraries shows that mobile libraries
    are, contrary to popular opinion, cheaper to run; they have
    larger and more frequently changed stocks and do not have to
    pay overheads for heating and lighting. village libraries
    cannot be cultural crystallisation centres if their stocks are
    inadequate. children are the main users of village libraries,
    which therefore stock mainly children's books. mobile libraries
    carry a larger proportion of adult material; fewer children's
    books are needed here since the children have access to good
    school libraries. good quality literature provision is always
    profitable and in contrast with village libraries, mobile
    libraries always have qualified staff. the travelling library
    is a good advertisement for library services.</text>

    <text>sharing development information. during the past 2 years,
    the information systems unit of the united nations department
    for international economic and social affairs has been running
    a pilot project to establish an automated information system,
    development information system, and to provide
    intradepartmental coordination of information systems
    activities. the system is now fully operational with a sample
    data base of almost 2,000 records. to avoid unnecessary
    duplication, full use was made of the devsis (development
    sciences information system) preliminary designs and the
    macrothesaurus. the minisis minicomputer system, developed by
    the international development research centre, is being tested
    for cost effectiveness. the system is compatible with several
    other united nations systems.</text>

    an automated client-tracking system on the clients,
    caseworkers, administrators, and operations of the welfare
    agencies that use it are reported. the major impact of this
    system was to enhance the administrative attractiveness of the
    using agencies in the eyes of funders rather than to increase
    their internal administrative efficiency. this impact is a
    joint product of both the technical features of the

    <text>some complete calculi for matrices a matrix calculus is
    introduced with the intention of developing data structures
    suitable for a high level algorithmic language for mathematical
    programming. the paper investigates how the special structure
    of matrices can be described and utilized for efficient
    computing by saving memory space and superfluous operations.
    sequences of matrices (and sequences of sequences of matrices)
    are considered, and matrix operators areext ended to sequence
    operators and cumulative operators. algorithms are given which
    use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions so as to find the
    forms best suited for computation. these forms are called
    normal forms. several completeness results are obtained in the
    sense that for each expression an equivalent expression in
    normal form can be found within a specified calculus. april,

    <text>feedback coupled resource allocation policies in the

    of some integrated, feedback-driven scheduling systems for
    multiprogrammed- multiprocessor computer systems are presented.
    the basic control variables used are the data-flow rates for
    the processes executing on the cpu. the model systems feature
    simulated continuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling of
    input-output activity. attention is given to the amount of
    memory resource required for effective processing of the i/o
    activity (buffer space assignment). the model studies used both
    distribution-driven and trace-driven techniques. even
    relatively simple dynamic schedulers are shown to improve

    inverted file, is a good eliminator of noise and information
    loss, providing high recall but low precision. precision can be
    increased through the process described, whereby semantic
    information from the morphological periphery of the roots can
    be obtained, which can be very relevant in information
    retrieval. the process involves relationships through

    school was set up at ibadan university in 1959 with a carnegie
    corporation grant. with the opening of other schools it is now
    possible to train most of the library personnel needed within
    nigeria. besides legislations for the national library, some
    state governments have passed laws for establishing library
    services. library provision is still uneven in nigeria;
    academic libraries have the best services and collections and

    <text>the acquisition of and bibliographic access to
    information-a task for libraries?. libraries should be
    responsible for acquiring 2informationsmittel1 as defined by
    georg schmoll supplying a summarised form of information
    sources and presenting it to the user in a practical form. at
    present this type of material (bibliographical material,
    including library catalogues) is not collected by libraries in
    sufficient quantities as it is often not available through
    normal market sources via publishers. as information material
    is generally in a processed form, libraries do not always
    classify the contents further. however, the form in which the
    material is made available to the user is very important as it
    should be possible to make independent use of the information.
    often the material is classified to be used by particular user
    groups, firms, library collectives or sectors of the
    information and documentation system. libraries must take into
    consideration which user groups need which information material
    in their area and also work with other libraries to provide a
    larger selection of national and international information
    material.</text>

    found that successive improvements to the display processor
    design lie on a circular path, by making improvements one can
    return to the original simple design plus one new general
    purpose computer for each trip around. the degree of physical

    <text>a study of errors, error-proneness, and error diagnosis
    in cobol this paper provides data on cobol error frequency for
    correction of errors in student-oriented compilers, improvement
    of teaching, and changes in programming language. cobol was
    studied because of economic importance, widespread usage,
    possible error-including design, and lack of research. the
    types of errors were identified in a pilot study; then, using
    the 132 error types found, 1,777 errors were classified in
    1,4000 runs of 73 cobol students. error density was high: 20
    percent of the types contained 80 percent of the total
    frequency, which implies high potential effectiveness for
    software based correction of cobol. surprisingly, only four
    high-frequency errors were error-prone, which implies minimal
    error inducing design. 80 percent of cobol misspellings were
    classifiable in the four error categories of previous
    researchers, which implies that cobol misspellings are
    correctable by existent algorithms. reserved word usage was not
    error-prone, which implies minimal interference with usage of
    reserved words. over 80 percent of error diagnosis was found to
    be inaccurate. such feedback is not optimal for users,
    particularly for the learning user of cobol. january, 1976

    <text>do stop this division. comments with regret on the fact
    that danish research libraries, which for 73 years had been
    part of the danish library association (danmarks
    biblioteksforening), felt it necessary in 1978 to form their
    own association (danmarks forskningsbiblioteksforenings) and
    thus causing a split in the danish library system. despite df's
    chairman's conciliatory remarks at db's 75 years' jubilee in
    1980 the national librarian, df's vice chairman, made sharp
    attacks on public libraries, db, the minister for cultural
    affairs and other politicians in his report to df's annual
    meeting 1981. he also attacked the new library bill, although
    this is supported by both the education and the cultural
    ministries. the bill proposes 1 overall administration and a
    directorate for each of the sectors, public and research.
    argues that df should support this unification of the library
    system. db should take the initiative by organising a meeting
    of all parties to discuss a link between the 2 organ
    isations.</text>

    <text>limits to collaborative authorship in science publishing.
    evidence is presented to demonstrate that the tendency for
    increased collaboration in science publishing does not proceed
    without limit. there appears to be a maximum extent of
    collaboration, related to the optimum size of a research unit.
    empirical corrections to allow for the sociological differences
    between various science subjects enable a generalised curve to
    be generated which appears to be a feature of research groups'
    dynamics. the study incorporates publication data from one
    research division over the last fifty years, with the
    time-independence of the relationship established by

    prussian ministry of education and the ministry's director of
    university and further education from 1897-1907. he was
    convinced that libraries were important not only as a basis for
    academic progress but also in the education of the people and
    national awareness. althoff worked in close cooperation with
    library directors, otto hartwig, karl dziatzko and august
    wilmanns. together they were responsible for carrying out
    innovations in library work which were of national importance
    and developed the prussian academic library system. among these
    developments were the introduction of the prussian library
    complete catalogue, the improvement of inter-lending systems
    between libraries, the founding of an information office of
    german libraries in the royal library in berlin (1905) and the
    opening of the kaiser-wilhelm library in posen in 1902.</text>

    <text>the library of the liepzig institute of technology.
    structure, development and present situation. the leipzig
    institute of technology was founded in 1977-80. before then
    several smaller institutes and colleges of engineering and
    related subjects existed, all with some kind of library. these
    libraries were integrated to form the new leipzig institute of
    technology library. the institute has a decentralised structure
    and the library was organised on the same lines. there is a
    main library with 5 department libraries, concentrating
    particularly on building collections for polygraphy and civil
    engineering, besides being responsible for collections of all
    the related subjects. the library provides support in training
    and research for students and staff of the institute and a rise
    in library users has been achieved. international relationships
    have been expanded, especially with similar institutes in the
    ussr. among the projects planned for 1981 are the formation of
    a selective bibliography for civil engineering and collecting
    and cataloguing research and development, travel and conference
    reports.</text>

    the basic language is minimal in the sense that no basic

    for-statements,and if-statements are not basic; they are
    special types of procedures. new "symbols" (underlined words in

    <text>a parametric algorithm for drawing pictures of solid

    pictures of three-dimensional objects, with surfaces made up of
    patches of quadric surfaces, is described. the emphasis of this
    algorithm is on calculating the intersections of quadric
    surfaces. a parameterization scheme is used. each quadric
    surface intersection curve (qsic) is represented as a set of
    coefficients and parameter limits. each value of the parameter
    represents at most two points, and these may easily be
    distinguished. this scheme can find the coordinates of points
    of even quartic (fourth-order) intersection curves, using
    equations of no more than second order. methods of
    parameterization for each type of osic are discussed, as well
    as surface bounding and hidden surface removal. october, 1976

    fiction cannot be classified by subject, while other works
    receive 2 or more subject cards. the classification was carried

    reference services, and overseeing the discarding of
    publications by selective depositories. discusses problems
    facing the regional depositories, including the increasing
    number of publications received, limited number of staff,
    insufficient financial support, and the need for controlled

    <text>measuring library services-to cut costs?. describes the

    particularly in the light of the british government's intention
    to introduce a process whereby local government must disclose
    information about its costs and performance to the public, with
    the result that expenditure by local authorities is reduced to
    the lowest spending authority's level, and not to the level of
    the authority providing the highest quality services. measures
    should reflect the desired outcome of the services offered, and
    librarian's attempts to audit their work will improve their

    <text>a weighted buddy method for dynamic storage allocation an
    extension of the buddy method, called the weighted buddy
    method, for dynamic storage allocation is presented. the
    weighted buddy method allows block sizes of 2^k and 3(2^k),
    whereas the original buddy method allowed only block sizes of
    2^k. this extension is achieved at an additional cost of only
    two bits per block. simulation results are presented which
    compare this method with the buddy method. these results
    indicate that for a uniform request distribution, the buddy
    system has less total memory fragmentation than the weighted
    buddy algorithm. however, the total fragmentation is smaller
    for the weighted buddy method when the requests are for
    exponentially distributed block sizes. october, 1974 shen, k.

    and in terms of their performance in retrieving patents taken
    from a master list of patents on genetic engineering and
    vitamin d, obtained by searches on 2world patents index.
    1timeliness of the services was also assessed. it was found

    cover patents satisfactorily and they are slow in picking up

    <text>on self-organizing sequential search heuristics this
    paper examines a class of heuristics for maintaining a

    the average time required to search for a specified element,
    assuming that each element is searched for with a fixed
    probability independent of previous searches performed. the
    "move to front" and "transposition" heuristics are shown to be
    optimal to within a constant factor, and the transposition rule
    is shown to be the more efficient of the two. empirical
    evidence suggests that transposition is in fact optimal for any
    distribution of search probabilities. february, 1976 rivest, r.

    <text>guides to teaching cobol the teaching of cobol can be
    divided into three main subject areas. they are the syntax of
    cobol, the use of such syntax in solving any given problem, and
    programming concepts. it is generally accepted that some
    knowledge of the hardware and computer logic must be possessed
    by the programmer. the teaching problem arises in determining
    how thoroughly a student must know the hardware and logic for
    that computer for which he will write cobol programs.
    unfortunately, historical data concerning students' programming
    proficiency is almost non-existent and, at best, difficult to
    measure. how then might we approach solving this problem? may,

    <text>the conversion of limited-entry decision tables to
    optimal and near-optimal flowcharts: two new algorithms two new
    algorithms for deriving optimal and near-optimal flowcharts
    from limited entry decision tables are presented. both take
    into account rule frequencies and the time needed to test
    conditions. one of the algorithms, called the optimum-finding
    algorithm, leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes execution
    time for a decision table in which simple rules are already
    contracted to complex rules. the other one, called the
    optimum-approaching algorithm, requires many fewer calculations
    but does not necessarily produce the optimum flowchart. the
    algorithms are first derived for treating decision tables not
    containing an else-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm
    is shown to be equally valid for tables including such a rule.
    both algorithms are compared with existing ones and are applied
    to a somewhat large decision table derived from a real case.
    from this comparison two conclusions are drawn. (1) the
    optimum-approaching algorithm will usually lead to better
    results than comparable existing ones and will not require
    more, but usually less, computation time.(2) in general, the
    greater computation effort needed for applying the
    optimum-finding algorithm will not be justified by the small
    reduction in execution time obtained. november, 1972 verhelst,

    <text>dynamic document processing the current role of computers
    in automatic document processing is briefly outlined, and some
    reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
    and of the mechanization of documentation processes has not
    been fulfilled. a new dynamic document environment is then
    outlined in which clustered files are searched and information
    is retrieved following an interactive user-controlled search
    process. methods are described for an automatic query
    modification based on user needs, and for a continuous
    reorganization of the stored information as a function of
    earlier file processing and of normal collection growth. the
    proposed procedures provide powerful tools for information
    retrieval and for the control of dynamic library collections in
    which new items are continually added and old ones are retired.

    librarians which have been published in the usa and the uk, and
    discusses a number of points for consideration when drawing up
    such a code for australian libraries. considers the issues that
    give rise to questions of professional ethics-in particular
    literature controls (censorship) and the client's right to
    privacy (freedom to read). argues that such a code should be
    precise and clear and take cognizance of the fact that

    <text>library services for the sick and handicapped in finland.
    contribution to a finnish issue. the organisation of hospital
    and nursing home libraries in finland is based on the 1961
    library act, the relevant passages of which are probably
    derived from the experiences of those municipalities which have
    provided such services since the 1940s. the libraries are the
    responsibility of the local public library and receive higher
    government grants than the public library. the institution and
    public library cooperate closely in the library's day-to-day
    running. outlines the activities in such libraries,
    deficiencies, staff training, and library services for
    non-hospitalised handicapped people. the whole subject is being

    music, and the location of a terminal on the desk. the majority
    of the respondents preferred an open space layout to layouts
    with some panels, and some background music to no music. these
    results are in conformity with the findings of most past
    studies. as to seating arrangements, they gave the highest
    preference to a random arrangement made independent of the
    employee's sex or seniority. with respect to the location of a

    <text>changes during the last ten years (1969-1978) in the
    academic library decision process for the placement and renewal
    of scholarly periodical subscriptions. an overview of the
    impact of funding restrictions on large us academic libraries
    during 1969-78. through most of the decade, the libraries
    relied on a series of strategies designed to minimise or hide
    their financial problems, shifting from monographic to serials
    expenditure and eliminating duplicates. only in the last few
    years have they been forced to turn to consortia and networks
    to alleviate the pressures on them. the libraries must face
    their problems squarely in the 1980s and produce leaders with
    the astuteness, courage, and persuasiveness to make faculty and
    administrators understand the problems. only then, within the
    framework of inter-institutional accord, will academic library
    cooperative activities move forward more rapidly and

    <text>dynamic partitioning for array languages the classical
    process of partitioning an array into subarrays is extended to
    a more useful array language operation. various modes of
    partitioning are defined for different types of arrays, so that
    subarrays may vary over the original array in a nearly
    arbitrary manner. these definitions are motivated with several
    realistic examples to illustrate the value of partitioning for
    array languages. of general interest is the data structure for
    partitioning. this consists of dynamic tree structures which
    are used to derive and maintain the array control information.
    these are described in sufficient detail to be of value in the
    design of other array languages. the description presented in
    this paper is implemented in a new array language, ol/2,
    currently under development at the university of illinois.

    <text>what an immigrant needs in the library. examines the

    yet solved the problem of selection or acquisition of suitable
    material. best results have been achieved with activities for
    children. meetings between library staff and immigrants could
    improve services. information to the danes about immigrants is
    varied and should be acquired by libraries. but there is a lack
    of material in danish on the immigrants' home background and
    cooperation is hampered by lack of immigrant leaders. the
    library school has not yet taken the subject up. 2 reports from
    the library inspectorate (1973, 1980) come up with proposals,
    and an ethiopian born librarian, i. abdullahi, in his
    'description of immigrants and libraries in denmark' (1981),
    contributes to the debate. he lists the information from
    libraries which immigrants need and suggests ways of improving

    describes a simple formula to determine on-line print costs for
    comparison with off-line charges for 2 major data base vendors

    french report by nora and minc is discussed fully with
    particular reference to its coverage of developments in
    telecommunications, the question of relations between
    government and commercial interests, the role of information in
    administration, and the social and cultural issues involved.
    recent us contributions to the literature predicting future

    related to the french viewpoint. considers the situation in
    spain and what kind of policy should be adopted in the light of
    initial findings, and in conclusion examines the question of
    security of information with reference to data bases and

    <text>the programmer's workbench-a machine for software
    development on almost all software development projects the

    be done on the same machine on which the eventual system will
    run. it is only when this production machine is unavailable or
    when its programming environment is totally inadequate that
    alternatives are considered. in this paper it is suggested that
    there are many other situations where it would be advantageous
    to separate the program development and main tenance function
    onto a specialized computer which is dedicated to that purpose.
    such a computer is here called a programmer's workbench. the

    <text>minimal-total-processing time drum and disk scheduling
    disciplines this article investigates the application of
    minimal-total-processing-time (mtpt) scheduling disciplines to
    rotating storage units when random arrival of requests is
    allowed. fixed-head drum and moving-head drum and moving-head
    disk storage units are considered, and emphasis is placed on
    the relative merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with
    respect to the shortest-latency-time-first (sltf) scheduling
    discipline. the results of the simulation studies presented
    show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally
    superior to the other. for most fixed-head drum applications,
    the sltf discipline is preferable to mtpt, but for
    intra-cylinder disk scheduling the mtpt discipline offers a
    distinct advantage over the sltf discipline. the computational
    requirements of an algorithm that implements the mtpt
    scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf
    algorithms. in both cases, the sorting procedure is the most
    time-consuming phase of the algorithm. july, 1974 fuller, s. h.

    extract from a project for a thesis in education sciences
    prepared for the university of montreal. american theses from
    1976-77 to 1980-81 on secondary school libraries have focussed
    on the topics of media programmes, personnel, and use, whereas
    in quebec interest has been concentrated chiefly on use. the

    constituting the past are defined, and the attitudes of the
    historian and the interpreter compared and contrasted; the
    communication process is then explained and illustrated; and a
    definition of interpretation derived and related to the

    <text>the university library's task of forming a system
    relative to the competence of the advisory and decision-making
    bodies of a large university. the freie universitat berlin
    (berlin university) in west berlin was taken as an example for
    analysis and suggestions concerning the university library's
    task of forming a library system. success in this task does not
    depend on the laws governing the library but is affected by the
    existing structure of the competent university bodies. the
    university library is required by law to coordinate, supervise
    and advise the department libraries. in order to carry out this
    task the system planning department must be completely
    integrated into the university internal information stream, it
    must be able to introduce initiatives into the advisory and
    decision-making procedures of the university and follow these
    up. this interdependent work was studied in detail at the
    berlin university. weak points in the system were analysed and
    suggestions for reducing prejud icial effects were made. this
    study should give rise to internal discussion at the university
    concerned and may also be of interest to other external
    libraries of similar structure.</text>

    <text>verifying properties of parallel programs: an axiomatic
    approach an axiomatic method for proving a number of properties
    of parallel programs is presented. hoare has given a set of
    axioms for partial correctness, but they are not strong enough
    in most cases. this paper defines a more powerful deductive
    system which is in some sense complete for partial correctness.
    a crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables,
    which are added to a parallel program as an aid to proving it
    correct. the information in a partial correctness proof can be
    used to prove such properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from
    deadlock, and program termination. techniques for verifying
    these properties are presented and illustrated by application
    to the dining philosophers problem. may, 1976 owicki, s. gries,

    <text>some basic determinants of computer programming

    relationship between processing characteristics of programs and
    experience characteristics of programmers and program
    development time. the ultimate objective was to develop a
    technique for predicting the amount of time necessary to create
    a computer program. the fifteen program characteristics
    hypothesized as being associated with an increase in
    programming time required are objectively measurable from
    preprogramming specifications. the five programmer
    characteristics are experience-related and are also measurable
    before a programming task is begun. nine program
    characteristics emerged as major influences on program
    development time, each associated with increased program
    development time. all five programmer characteristics were
    found to be related to reduced program development time. a
    multiple regression equation which contained one programmer
    characteristic and four program characteristics gave evidence
    of good predictive power for forecasting program development
    time. june, 1978 chrysler, e. programmer performance standards,

    to minimise programme execution time. a 2nd, earlier-developed
    algorithm is used with the 1st algorithm to allocate a fixed

    exemplified in detail. the system is written in lisp 1.5 and
    operates on the q-32 time-sharing system. the system's data
    structures and their semantic organization, the deductive
    question-answering formalism of relational properties and
    complex-relation-forming operators, and the question-answering
    procedures which employ these features in their operation are
    all described and illustrated. examples of the system's
    performance and of the limitations of its question-answering
    capability are presented and discussed. it is shown that the
    use of semantic information in deductive question answering
    greatly facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure
    which works from question to answer enables effective use to be
    made of this information. it is concluded that the development
    of protosynthex iii into a practically useful system to work
    with large data bases is possible but will require changes in

    <text>a comparison between mobile and stationary libraries in
    rural areas with reference to costs and performance. there is
    still disagreement over whether mobile or stationary libraries
    provide the best service for rural areas with populations under
    5,000. mobile libraries permit flexible organisation and can
    come close to users' homes; they are operated by professional
    staff who bring a large and varied book stock supplemented by
    central reserves. since they are only in 1 place for a short
    time, however, they cannot easily become cultural centres.
    small stationary branch libraries in rural areas have small,
    restricted stocks and are rarely served by professional staff.
    a comparison of initial and running costs for mobile and small
    stationary branch libraries in middle franconia reveals that
    mobile library provision is the cheaper method and a comparison
    of performances, that it is the more efficient.</text>

    systems (mis) bear little relation to the information systems
    currently in use by top management in most us local

    involving the use of relatively unsophisticated applications.
    despite the unsophisticated nature of these systems, management
    use of computing is surprisingly common, but also varied in its
    extent among local governments. management computing is most
    prevalent in those governments with professional management
    practices where top management is supportive of computing and
    tends to control computing decisions and where department users
    have less control over design and implementation activities.

    <text>use of tree structures for processing files in data
    processing problems, files are frequently used which must both
    be searched and altered. binary search techniques are efficient
    for searching large files, but the associated file organization
    is not readily adapted to the file alterations. conversely, a
    chained file allocation permits efficient alteration but cannot
    be searched efficiently. a file organized into a tree-like
    structure is discussed, and it is shown that such a file may
    both be searched and altered with times proportional to
    slog(s)n, where n is the number of file items and s is a
    parameter of the tree. it is also shown that optimizing the
    value of s leads to a search time which is only 25 per cent
    slower than the binary search. the tree organization employs
    two data chains and may be considered to be a compromise
    between the organizations for the binary search and the chained
    file. the relation of the tree organization to multidimensional
    indexing and to the trie structure is also discussed. may, 1963

    <text>a hardware architecture for implementing protection rings
    protection of computations and information is an important
    aspect of a computer utility. in a system which uses
    segmentation as a memory addressing scheme, protection can be
    achieved in part by associating concentric rings of decreasing
    access privilege with a computation. this paper describes
    hardware processor mechanisms for implementing these rings of
    protection. the mechanisms for implementing these rings of
    protection. the mechanisms allow cross-ring calls and
    subsequent returns to occur without trapping to the supervisor.
    automatic hardware validation of references across ring
    boundaries is also performed. thus, a call by a user procedure
    to a protected subsystem (including the supervisor) is
    identical to a call to a companion user procedure. the
    mechanisms of passing and referencing arguments are the same in
    both cases as well. march, 1972 schroeder, m. d. saltzer, j. h.

    <text>generation of rosary permutations expressed in
    hamiltonian circuits systematic generation of a specific class
    of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is
    described. in a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices,
    hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5(n - 1)! specific
    permutations of n elements, termed rosary permutations, can be
    defined. each of them corresponds to two circular permutations
    which mirror-image each other, and is generated successively by
    a number system covering 3*4*...*(n-1) sets of edges. every set
    of edges {e[k]}, 1 &lt;= e[k] &lt;= k, 3 &lt;= k &lt;= (n-1) is
    determined recursively by constructing a hamiltonian circuit
    with k vertices from a hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices,
    starting with the hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices. the basic
    operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent
    vertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is
    determined by {e[k]}. two algorithms treating the same example
    for five vertices are presented. it is very easy to derive all
    possible n! permutations from the .5(n - 1 )! rosary
    permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in
    the reverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly

    <text>the jena literary museum 1816-1919. the museum was
    administered by a group of members with literary and scientific
    interests who wished to obtain information on political and
    topical matters outside their work. the building up of a
    comprehensive periodical collection foreshadowed a modern
    trend. stocks were acquired through cooperative agreements
    with' the grand duke's library in weimar; jena university
    library, for which the museum became a reading-room until 1915;
    the weimar book museum; the carl zeiss foundation. many private
    members also donated their journals to the museum. when the
    public reading room opened in jena in 1896, reflecting the
    development of cultural and political thought, it flourished;
    the museum, in contrast, wished to remain the preserve of a
    well-educated, fee-paying minority and thus restricted its own
    development. ultimately the museum became part of the
    university library.</text>

    <text>union catalogues to foreign literature in uzbekistan.
    union catalogues prepared by the state public scientific and
    technical library of the ussr are a useful tool for the
    coordination of acquisition of foreign literature, however,
    these catalogues cover only the stock of 15 out of the 50
    uzbekistan libraries. the union indexes prepared by uzbekistan
    libraries are therefore of great importance. discusses the
    union indexes to foreign literature prepared by and available
    in uzbekistan libraries which are used for coordination of
    acquisition of foreign literature. amongst these are: union
    index to foreign periodicals and union index to new foreign
    books published by the main library of the academy of sciences
    of the uzbekistan ssr, union index to foreign medical
    periodicals prepared by the national medical library and 2
    union indexes prepared by the national scientific and technical
    library, namely card index to foreign periodicals (covers the
    period 1880-1967) and union index to fore ign periodicals held

    <text>abn and the art of cost-effective cataloguing: the
    challenge in library automation for the early eighties. the
    national library of australia has received permission to
    develop an australian bibliographic network (abn), but no extra
    resources have been granted for it; the service may therefore
    not be able to serve all its potential participants as quickly
    as some would like. suggests that through the creation of
    'service centre' networks, and without the need for a major
    supportive infrastructure from the national library, the
    benefits of the abn's existence can be brought to a great many
    libraries. suggests ways in which abn may be integrated into a
    national network which will coordinate the national library's
    initiatives and the 'bottom-up' developments which have already
    taken place and will continue to take place.</text>

    <text>the crisis of danish specialised bibliographies. argues
    that, whereas the danish national bibliography is in no danger
    as it is subsidised through the library centre and acquired
    widely by all types of library, the selective, specialised
    bibliographies are given low priority. the national
    bibliography has traditionally formed the basis of compilation
    of selective bibliographies, but with automation it is less
    suitable for subject searches. gives examples of specialised
    bibliographies whose selections are not based on the evaluation
    of qualified people of the total production within a subject.
    the danish joint bibliographic committee set up on the
    instigation of unesco lacks influence on the production of
    specialised bibliographies. urges the library centre and public
    libraries to pay as much attention to the analytical, danish
    specialised bibliographies as they do to the national
    bibliography.</text>

    <text>recent developments in telecommunications and their
    impact on information services. following a reminder of what
    telecommunication involves, the features and characteristics of
    various transmission media are reviewed. these comprise wire or
    cable media both metallic (twisted pairs and coaxial cable) and
    nonmetallic (optical fibres) as well as free space propagation
    methods such as tv broadcasting and microwave radio. also
    discusses the techniques in networking using these media and
    describes systems and services which, in their evolution are
    making use of the new developments in telecommunications. these
    include videotex, teletext, catv, the electronic directory,
    electronic mail and messaging, teleconferencing and
    telewriting, facsimile, networks and data base handling. the
    impact these new developments, both technologies and resulting
    systems, are having on information services is examined from
    the point of view of user reactions, benefits, problems and
    effects. stresses that information services have become much
    broader in scope than has hitherto been understood by
    traditional library and information services and they now
    include services prepared specifically for the domestic and

    there is general satisfaction with its principles and

    larger minimum areas for periodicals, reading places and youth
    libraries; the addition of office accommodation, audio-visual
    equipment and separate study accommodation as obligatory; the
    relationship between a 'recommended' level of provision and the

    small branches without providing a satisfactory alternative
    such as mobile libraries; a more positive attitude to

    <text>code extension in ascii* (an asa tutorial) the american
    standard code for information interchange (ascii) contains a
    number of control characters associated with the principle of
    code extension, that is, with the representation of information
    which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
    in the code. the manner of use of these characters has not
    previously been completely described. this paper presents a set
    of mutually consistent philosophies regarding code extension
    applications, and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the
    application of the code extension characters. distinctions are
    drawn between code extension and such other concepts as
    "graphic substitution" or "syntactic representation" which are
    often used to meet similar requirements. also covered are
    certain topics which are not truly concerned with code
    extension but which are often linked with it in discussion on
    code applications. the material in this paper is equally
    applicable in principle to the (proposed) iso international
    7-bit code for information interchange. october, 1966 ca661005

    <text>agricultural librarianship and documentation as a
    profession. translation of a paper presented at a congress of
    the iaald in manila in 1980, giving a general view of library
    and information services in the agricultural field in relation
    to librarianship in general and in other fields. a preliminary
    definition sets out the nature of the work of the agricultural
    librarian, and then the special characteristics of the field
    are discussed in detail' its interdisciplinary nature, the wide
    range of types of documentation, its international character,
    and the need to disseminate information to a diverse community
    representing a wide variety of educational backgrounds. the
    organisation and operation of existing services are examined
    with reference to information resources and cooperative
    activities, where the extent to which network opportunities are
    used depends on the scale and focus of services offered, and
    this in turn influences professional duties. the education and
    skills essential for the p rofessional are analysed in relation
    to the changes in information and library services in general
    caused by social and technological developments, which have
    created a need for alterations in library school curricula and
    the establishment of programmes of continuing education for
    practising librarians. finally potential developments to meet
    the demands of the future are considered.</text>

    <text>decision support systems in libraries. following a review
    of the contributions of computers and managerial
    science/operations research to the management of libraries,
    this paper introduces the concept of decision support systems.
    dss, a blending of these techniques, can lead to more effective
    decisions by library managers. a case study of the utilisation
    of a dss in the budgeting process of a medium sized library
    illustrates the process. report not available from ntis.</text>

    <text>formal parsing systems automatic syntactic analysis has
    recently become important for both natural language data
    processing and syntax-directed compilers. a formal parsing
    system g = (v,u,t,r) consists of two finite disjoint
    vocabularies, v and t, a many-many map, u, from v onto t, and a
    recursive set r of strings in t called syntactic sentence
    classes. every program for automatic syntactic analysis
    determines a formal parsing system. a directed production
    analyzer (i,t,x,p) is a nondeterministic pushdown-store machine
    with internal vocabulary i, input vocabulary t, and all
    productions of p in the form: (z,a) -&gt; ay1 ... ym where z,
    yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of the set t.
    every context-free language can be analyzed by a directed
    production analyzer. the kuno-oettinger multiple-path syntactic
    analyzer for english is a concrete example of a directed
    production analyzer and of a working parsing algorithm. the
    connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and
    those of a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in
    this paper. august, 1964 greibach, s. a. ca640818 jb march 9,

    <text>relative impact of print and database products on
    database producer expenses and income-trends for database
    producer organizations based on a thirteen year financial
    analysis. a 13-year analysis of the finances of a major data
    base producer organisation, which is also a publisher of
    abstracting and indexing products, indicates trends regarding
    the impact that both printed products and data base products
    have on the financial status of the organisation. the question
    of 'migration' (from printed to on-line data base products) and
    the fact that expenses have increased more than income are
    discussed as they relate to the survival or growth of data base
    organisations. since the data base has gone on-line, there have
    been significant increases in the data base revenue, connect
    hours, and numbers of on-line users. at the same time, there
    have been decreases in the number of data base leases and
    licences, the number of print product subscriptions, and the
    excess of income over expenses. in consta nt dollars, the cost
    of producing an abstract has decreased, the subscription charge
    for printed products has increased only slightly, the lease and
    license fees have decreased, royalty charges have increased,
    and hourly connect fees have remained steady (even though the
    size of the on-line file has increased greatly). the problem is
    that of maintaining a balanced financial status in light of
    increased income from one class of products, decreased income
    from another class of products, and increased cost of
    operation. possible approaches to ensure economic viability are
    considered in terms of expenses, efficiency of operation,
    marketing, products, services, and pricing. the most promising
    approaches lie in the areas of pricing and development of new
    products and servi ces. the possibility of developing a
    consortium of data base producers for offering on-line services
    is proposed. there appears to be no alternative to increasing
    the prices for on-line users.</text>

    requirements posed definite problems in system design,
    particularly the handling of the reporting function. a

    easier to debug, easy to maintain, efficient in production and

    <text>automatic data structure choice in a language of very
    high level setl is a set-theoretically oriented language of
    very high level whose repertoire of semantic objects includes
    finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and sets of ordered n-tuples
    usable as mappings. this paper describes the structure of an
    optimizer for this language. among other methods of interest,
    the optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of
    inclusion and membership to be established, the domains and
    ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated from above and
    below, and the single-valuedness of (tabulated) mappings to be
    proved. once facts of this kind have been established,
    automatic choice of data structures becomes possible. the
    methods employed are based upon, and extend, known techniques
    of data flow analysis. december, 1975 schwartz, j. t. program

    <text>library services to the disadvantaged: not quite what
    they seem. paper presented at the uk public libraries group
    weekend school, bath 1980. discusses the standard of the
    provision made by uk public libraries for the disadvantaged,
    and argues that, whilst libraries have largely responded to the
    needs of the institutionally disadvantaged (eg hospital
    patients, the handicapped, and prison inmates), the socially
    and culturally disadvantaged have been largely ignored.
    identifies a basic dichotomy which has 2 aspects: the disparity
    between levels of provision for various disadvantaged groups;
    and the disparity between service to the disadvantaged and
    service to the community at large. reports criticisms which
    have been made of the inadequacy of the work done by libraries
    with ethnic minorities, in deprived areas, and with relation to
    functional literacy and the encouragement of reading. stresses
    the need for the provision of courses on, and the initiation of
    research into, library services for the disadvantaged.</text>

    <text>design of computer simulation experiments for industrial
    systems the aim of this paper is to provide background
    information on the existing literature on experimental design
    techniques which may be applicable to the design of computer
    simulation experiments for industrial systems. although major
    emphasis is placed on analysis of variance techniques, three
    other techniques of data analysis are considered-multiple
    ranking procedures, sequential sampling and spectral analysis.
    the paper treats four specific experimental design problems and
    several techniques for solving them. the four experimental
    design problems are: (1) the problem of stochastic convergence,
    (2) the problem of factor selection, (3) the problem of motive
    and (4) the many response problem. may, 1966 burdick, d. s.

    <text>blocks-a new data type for snobol4 a new data type,
    called a block, has been implemented for snobol4. a block is a
    three-dimensional aggregate of characters in the form of a
    right parallelepiped, best thought of as a three-dimensional
    extension to a string. (the third dimension is used for
    overstriking.) blocks may be printed, concatenated in any of
    three dimensions, and merged on the basis of program-defined
    connection points. some blocks adapt in size and shape to their
    environment. blocks and their operations are mainly used for
    composing printable output. a variety of graphical problems
    (including flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams,
    mathematical-equation formation, and text justification and
    preparation) have been programmed on a printer in what appears
    to be an easy and natural way. in addition to these somewhat
    specialized applications, blocks appear to be a good general
    purpose device-independent output formation mechanism
    especially suitable for nonnumerical work. the concept of a
    block is largely language independent.that is, blocks require
    little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily be
    absorbed into the external structure of most programming
    languages. june, 1972 gimpel, j. f. character manipulation,

    <text>public library needs for blacks' a personal view. in
    south africa it often is alleged that blacks require the public
    library to offer services by which they can advance their
    knowledge and capabilities. on the maslow pyramid this could be
    considered a need at the basic level, while the reading of
    recreative works could be considered to lie at a higher level.
    in fact it is found that 72% of books borrowed by blacks
    consist of fiction. it may now be questioned whether the black
    community has already passed the basic reading level, or
    whether recreational reading forms part of that level. as some
    66% of the black membership of a library may consist of
    children, the high percentage of fiction circulated raises
    doubts about whether these children see libraries primarily as
    sources of information, and about the suitability of
    non-fiction provided. only about 5% of blacks use available
    library facilities. it should be investigated whether the
    educational approach is not being over-stressed in black public
    libraries.</text>

    <text>exclusive simulation of activity in digital networks a
    technique for simulating the detailed logic networks of large
    and active digital systems is described. essential objectives
    sought are improved ease and economy in model generation,
    economy in execution time and space, and a facility for
    handling simultaneous activities. the main results obtained are
    a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
    model description, a reduction of manual tasks in converting
    boolean logic into a structural model, the elimination of
    manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity,
    an event-scheduling technique which does not deteriorate in
    economy as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
    procedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial
    and simultaneous activities. the passage of time is simulated
    in a precise, quantitative fashion and systems to be simulated
    may be combinations of synchronous and asynchronous logic.
    certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the
    simulation of network structures other than digital networks.

    rules are the result of a desire for true international
    uniformity, though they are still 'anglo-american' in their
    preference of english forms. aacr2 gives equal status to book
    and non-book materials. there is much less stress on
    'authorship' and more on 'responsibility'. the uniform
    structure of all chapters is described. describes important
    changes-as compared to aacr1-in rules for descriptive
    cataloguing and headings. some reservations are made about
    headings for jewish religious works. the decision by lc to
    carry out 'desuperimposition' and to close its catalogue is
    noted, and its effect on us libraries discussed. israeli
    cataloguing has traditionally followed us practice, and israeli
    libraries will adopt aacr2 sooner or later to avail themselves
    of foreign cataloguing and to enable israeli cataloguing to
    become part of the international network of bibliographic
    control. y et, it is not imperative to adopt aacr2 immediately.
    it is desirable to wait and see how us libraries accustom
    themselves to the changes and to see how lc implements and
    interprets the rules. meanwhile it is suggested that all
    options in aacr2 be checked, and a uniform israeli practice be
    adopted. it is also desirable that the feasibility of adopting
    aacr2 at the highest level of description by 2kiryath sepher1,
    the israel national bibliography, be checked.</text>

    <text>liberalism incarnate and mediocrity on the rails.
    interviews the author, per hojholt, who argues that libraries
    could support quality literature more effectively by ordering
    more copies of good books. instead libraries, giving in to
    popular demand, contain a surfeit of mediocre authors. local
    freedom to select is largely an illusion as in practice the
    binding centre's reviews are heavily relied upon. the
    popularity of sociological and women's novels should not be
    ignored entirely, however, as libraries have an obligation to
    cater both for quality and topicality. authors of school and
    children's books, on the one hand, and of adult books, on the
    other, should have their library fees assessed separately. the
    work of children's librarians is educational and social and
    their training should reflect this; literary quality hardly
    applies to children's literature. suggests sale of books in
    libraries to ensure the survival of the book trade.</text>

    <text>the danish publishing world abroad or the children's book
    fair in bologna 1981. the 1981 fair illustrated the miserable
    nature of present-day publishing but was a true picture of
    children's literature, 80% of which consists of comics,
    picture-books and coloured books, all in poor taste. children's
    books in general are at a low level-the tv screen in book
    form-and the question is whether colours and pictures sell
    whereas culture does not. scandinavian book production differs
    markedly from that of other countries in variety, breadth and
    well-defined taste but is in an obviously scandinavian style.
    the 1981 bologna fair was dull, with little new or
    outstandingly interesting, and business also appeared to be
    poor and mostly concerned with joint book-production in
    different countries. joint production enables danish publishers
    to issue quality picture books but also has increasingly become
    the means by which danish books can appear in other
    countries.</text>

    <text>libraries and the organization of universities in france,
    1789-1881. examines the ways in which the interests of
    promoting libraries and the promotion of higher education
    converged in the development of french university libraries in
    the 19th century. the revolution of 1789 abolished universities
    and confiscated their libraries. the imperial university, an
    educational bureaucracy that survived the empire and endured
    for most of the 19th century, did not promote research or
    require research libraries. however, in 1855 efforts began to
    replace the imperial system with autonomous universities, and
    these efforts focused on the role of university libraries. in
    1881 university libraries were created in the provinces as a
    1st step toward creating universities, 15 years before the de
    jure establishment of universities.</text>

    <text>execution time requirements for encipherment programs
    although encipherment has often been discussed as a means to
    protect computer data, its costs are not well established. five
    experiments were conducted to measure the cpu time on a cdc
    6400 required by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly
    language and in fortran: a "null transformation" to measure the
    time to move data without encipherment; encipherment with
    one-word key; encipherment with a 125-word key; double key
    encipherment; and encipherment using a pseudo random key. the
    results were analyzed for consistency over 100 runs, and the
    effects of constant and intermittent errors were considered.
    timing rates for assembly language encipherment ranged from
    498,800 characters per second for a pseudo random key cipher to
    2,092,000 characters per second for a constant one-word key
    cipher. the latter is almost equivalent to the rate required
    simply to move data without encipherment. fortran tests
    required over four times as much cpu time. this paper
    introduces the idea on enciphering time coefficient the ratio
    of enciphering time to the time taken to fetch and store data
    without encipherment. august, 1974 friedman, t. d. offman, l.

    <text>feature comparison of an in-house information retrieval
    system with a commercial search service. a commercially
    available on-line search service was used as a standard for
    comparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information
    system based on automatic indexing. system features were
    identified and evaluated on the basis of their usefulness in
    various kinds of searching, their ease in implementation, and
    how they are influenced by differences in user type or specific
    applications. some common features of the commercial system,
    such as on-line instruction, user-specified print formats,
    dictionary display, and truncation, are seen to be unnecessary
    or impractical for the in-house system.</text>

    <text>preserving average proximity in arrays programmers and
    data structure designers are often forced to choose between
    alternative structures. in storing these structures, preserving
    logical adjacencies or "proximity" is usually an important
    consideration. the combinatorial problem of storing arrays as
    various kinds of list structures is examined. embeddings of
    graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involved in such
    storage schemes, and an elementary proof that arrays cannot be
    stored as linear lists with bounded loss of proximity is
    presented. average loss of proximity is then considered, and it
    is shown that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with only
    bounded loss of average proximity, but can be so stored in
    binary trees. the former result implies, for instance, that row
    major order is an asymptotically optimal storage strategy for
    arrays. march, 1978 demillo, r.a. eisenstat, s.c. lipton, r.j.

    section was held in the state mines central laboratory at
    geleen on 17 sept 41 and the 1st meeting of members on 29 oct

    <text>a technique for computer detection and correction of
    spelling errors* the method described assumes that a word which
    cannot be found in a dictionary has at most one error, which
    might be a wrong, missing or extra letter or a single
    transposition. the unidentified input word is compared to the
    dictionary again, testing each time to see if the words
    match-assuming one of these errors occurred. during a test run
    on garbled text, correct identifications were made for over 95
    percent of these error types. march, 1964 damerau, f. j.

    there were 325 card holders, the number of library visits
    amounted to 2,350, loan data to 4,500 volumes. during 1971-80
    the library performed 426 literature searches including 7,680
    bibliographic entries. from the total of 1,387 bibliographic
    data in 1979, 947 original documents were requested, 51 of
    which were not available. investigation of the citations in the
    communications by the hospital's staff revealed a 64%
    utilisation of the bibliographic entries in 1979. repeated

    <text>a critical survey of union catalogues in universities.
    efforts made since the mid 19th century to produce alphabetical
    union catalogues of all books within a university have been
    hampered by the difficulty of access to some institute library
    stocks, by inaccurate cataloguing in institute libraries and by
    the questionable value of a central catalogue within purchasing
    policy. since 1970, however, professional opinion has been
    increasingly in favour of union catalogues in universities;
    work in this field at various universities is described and
    evaluated through analysis of interlibrary loan figures. these
    catalogues should be produced only when certain conditions
    prevail, e.g. when institute stock subject coverage is much
    wider than that of the central library, when access to the
    union catalogue is easy and when the catalogue can be produced
    without detriment to other work.</text>

    listening to music and even little push-chairs for the smallest
    children are provided in libraries with a large proportion of
    child readers. all libraries contain at least one room for

    to provide danish-language children's books to support teaching

    speaking only that language. the main library in godthab (later
    designated the greenland national library) began to build a

    its speed highlights the present slowness of document delivery;

    expansion of higher education at the end of the 1950s. the

    with details of the various ways in which such companies have
    penetrated the book industry and protective legislation
    designed to encourage national companies. brazilian firms are
    mainly hampered by lack of capital; strategies used to
    circumvent this problem are discussed. the multinationals
    currently established in book production are listed; many
    brazilians, however, are involved in these companies, while
    some multinationals are covertly involved in national
    companies. hence the division of the market between foreign and

    <text>storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when storage
    assignment is performed by a hashing algorithm the utilization
    of storage is studied in a two-level memory hierarchy. the
    first storage level, which is the fast store, is divided into a
    number of storage areas. when an entry is to be filed in the
    hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry
    into one of these areas. if this particular area is full, then
    the entry will be placed into the slower second-level store,
    even though other areas in the first-level store may have space
    available. given the n entries have been filed in the entire
    hierarchy, an expression is derived for the expected number of
    entries filed in the first-level store.this expression gives a
    measure of how effectively the first-level store is being used.
    by means of examples, storage utilization is then studied as a
    function of the hashing algorithm, the number of storage areas
    into which the first-level store is divided and the total size
    of the first-level store. march, 1971 williams, j. g. hashing

    <text>some features of the development of research library book
    stocks within a region. over the last 20 years there has been a
    rapid growth both in the numbers of libraries and in the size
    of their stocks. belorussia provides an example of this and its
    statistics can be favourably compared with those of the ussr as
    a whole. the development of new libraries into cooperative
    networks necessitated specialisation in book selection, but
    there was found to be little value in small libraries
    specialising while all the larger ones maintained universal
    stocks. various methods of profiling were used to avoid
    this.</text>

    publishing is very local and only newspapers in these minority
    languages are occasionally available outside the area of
    origin. books are listed in the 2soviet national bibliography1,
    but only in the russian language. each autonomous republic
    issues its own national bibliography, the oldest established

    <text>a practical interprocedural data flow analysis algorithm
    a new interprocedural data flow analysis algorithm is presented
    and analyzed. the algorithm associates with each procedure in a
    program information about which variables may be modified,
    which may be used, and which are possibly preserved by a call
    on the procedure, and all of its subcalls. the algorithm is
    sufficiently powerful to be used on recursive programs and to
    deal with the sharing of variables which arises through
    reference parameters. the algorithm is unique in that it can
    compute all of this information in a single pass, not requiring
    a prepass to compute calling relationships or sharing patterns.
    the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in time complexity. it
    has been implemented and is practical even on programs which
    are quite large. september, 1978 barth, j.m. data flow

    <text>the enforced re-organization of industrial libraries.
    (fla thesis). considers the industrial library as part of a
    profit-motivated organisation, providing a literature and
    information service for the benefit of its parent company. the
    service provided must be integrated into the management and
    control structure of the company. as part of the organisation
    the library is subject to management control in the same way as
    any other part of the organisation. management decisions, made
    in a broader context than the library, affect the library's
    operation and its functions and staff. the effect of these
    decisions on the library are examined in a number of cases with
    particular emphasis on the policy decisions taken by ferranti

    <text>library science in theory and practice. in the usa, uk
    and communist countries, library science is now fully
    established as a scientific discipline and included amongst
    university faculties. since the 19th century, however, opinion
    in west germany has been divided as to whether library science
    has its own theoretic basis or whether it consists of purely
    practical knowledge. examination of the respective arguments
    suggests that library science can be regarded as an applied
    science closely linked with other disciplines, e.g. information
    science, communication, cybernetics and linguistics. historical
    aspects of librarianship emphasised hitherto should play only a
    subordinate role; the main emphasis must be on scientifically
    based, economic library administration linked with research.
    cologne is the only german university possessing a library
    science faculty; more such faculties are needed to produce
    librarians of the required calibre.</text>

    in which the operand of every such "span-dependent" instruction
    is either a label or an assembly-time expression of a certain

    these operands to be more general assembly-time expressions,

    <text>will the state take the financial backbone out of the
    library act?. state grants to the vest-agder (norway) county
    library amounted in 1980 to 35% of its budget. recent proposals
    by the juel committee on local government reform would mean the
    withdrawal of state support. if responsibility for library
    service devolves entirely on local authorities, the norwegian
    public library system will be threatened by disintegration,
    with national library duties concentrated in a few state-owned
    special libraries. since even the revised library act of 1971
    did not oblige counties to operate a library service, the
    system has been established and developed largely through the
    influence and support of central authority. the basis for the
    1971 act was the long-standing regional imbalance in school
    library and public library standards. under the new proposals,
    libraries in the most deprived areas would be in most danger,
    and cultural activity as a whole would be vulnerable to

    to obtain musical recordings of interest to them and related
    reference material. but some readers need qualified specialist
    help. most people visit the music library hoping to find some
    sort of club. librarians must estimate which resources would
    achieve the music library's aims. a large record library and
    good technical equipment are essential. series of slides
    accompanying the music create a better artistic and historic
    atmosphere. the librarian should observe all new events in the
    musical world, maintaining close contact with his audience's
    interests and developing individual and group activities to
    make the music section a centre of attraction.</text>

    <text>how to keep the addresses short an algorithm is presented
    for minimizing the sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding
    produced by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of
    each computer instruction is assumed to be either "long" or
    "short" ("long," if the memory location addressed is more than
    a predetermined distance from the current location; "short,"
    otherwise), and (2) there are blocks of instructions whose
    beginnings (origins) are separated by prespecified amounts. for
    example, some computers permit either 8-bit addressing
    (interpreted relative to the location counter) or full 16-bit
    addressing of all of memory. when assembling or compiling two
    or more blocks of instructions which have many mutual
    references in such a computer, there is no simple iterative
    procedure for keeping as many of the addresses short as
    possible. this paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems
    of this type can be formulated as covering problems solvable by
    means of elementary arithmetic operations on the column vectors
    of a ternary matrix. may, 1971 richards, d. l. addressing,

    <text>characteristics of application software maintenance
    maintenance and enhancement of application software consume a
    major portion of the total life cycle cost of a system. rough
    estimates of the total systems and programming resources
    consumed range as high as 75-80 percent in each category.
    however, the area has been given little attention in the
    literature. to analyze the problems in this area a
    questionnaire was developed and pretested. it was then
    submitted to 120 organizations. respondents totaled 69.
    responses were analyzed with the spss statistical package. the
    results of the analysis indicate that: (1) maintenance and
    enhancement do consume much of the total resources of systems
    and programming groups; (2) maintenance and enhancement tend to
    be viewed by management as at least somewhat more important
    than new application software development; (3) in maintenance
    and enhancement, problems of a management orientation tend to
    be more significant than those of a technical orientation; and
    (4) user demands for enhancements and extension constitute the
    most important management problem area. june, 1978 lientz, b.p.

    is established to appraise the state of the art and to develop
    a series of recommendations for improving computer education
    for management. to provide the committee with material for its
    study of curricular needs, five regional meetings in the united
    states were held in 1970, at each of which a broad cross
    section of invited academicians and practitioners considered
    the state of curricula in business schools. three topics were
    covered: curricula for the general manager; computer-related
    material in required and functional courses; and curricula for
    students concentrating on computer-based information systems.
    an analysis of the minutes of the meetings revealed a common
    set of experiences which raised similar pedagogic and economic
    issues. this presentation gives a summary of the discussions; a
    condensation of the pedagogic and substantive concerns raised;
    and consideration of the resource allocation issues involved.
    preliminary to the committee's recommendations for improving
    computer education for management, this report has been
    prepared to provide the participants and the administrators of
    their institutions with background information for the ongoing
    task of course development. chairman of the ten-man committee

    <text>automatic derivation of microsentences the decomposition
    of long complex english sentences into shorter kernel-like
    constituent sentences (microsentences)has often been suggested
    as an avenue toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural
    language messages. to explore the prospects of such a step, the
    authors attempted in 1963 to prepare a general program for
    deriving microsentences from longer sentences that had been
    syntactically analyzed by the harvard multipath analysis
    program. the basic idea was to extract the subject, verb and
    object (if any) of each clause and to reassemble these
    materials into a grammatical microsentence. a program is
    described in this paper, which was designed to operate on the
    tree structure output of the analyzer, and the microsentences
    that were produced are exhibited. the authors conclude that
    while microsentences of the quality achieved do not open up
    immediate prospects for improving the performance of automatic
    message retrieval systems, they may have practical value in
    man-machine systems using human monitors to select the
    preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence. june, 1966

    <text>packed scatter tables scatter tables for open addressing
    benefit from recursive entry displacements, cutoffs for
    unsuccessful searches, and auxiliary cost functions. compared
    with conventional methods, the new techniques provide
    substantially improved tables that resemble exact-solution
    optimal packings. the displacements are depth-limited
    approximations to an enumerative (exhaustive) optimization,
    although packing costs remain linear-o(n)-with table size n.
    the techniques are primarily suited for important fixed (but
    possibly quite large) tables for which reference frequencies
    may be known: op-code tables,spelling dictionaries, access
    arrays. introduction of frequency weights further improves
    retrievals, but the enhancement may degrade cutoffs. october,

    can it be put into practice?. cooperation between the library
    and the stei systems within a region is a long standing
    problem, the aim of which has always been the paramount right
    of the reader to have access to all available literature
    sources. although the ministry of culture together with the

    development of a unified library system in the czechoslovak
    socialist republic', it remained only methodological advice.
    there is simply not enough cooperation. the spheres in which

    <text>degree of multiprogramming in page-on-demand systems a
    simple stochastic model is described which offers a base for
    understanding the relationship between the number of programs
    permitted to share memory (the degree of multiprogramming),
    drum traffic rates, and central processing unit utilization in
    page-on-demand, multiprogrammed, time-shared computer systems.
    the model preserves, as a key feature, the property of
    page-demand statistics which implies a "burst" of page demands
    at the beginning of any job or quantum execution. the model, a
    markov chain, is analyzed numerically and the results are
    presented graphically for a wide range of key
    environment-descriptive parameters. implications of the results
    to time-shared system design and programming are discussed, and
    a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming for a
    wide range of parameters is presented graphically. june, 1969

    multi-level exit statements for sequence control. it is also
    shown that if,while, and repeat statements with single-level
    exit do not suffice. it is also shown that any flowcharts can

    values of the variables are changing with time. it is supposed
    further that it is desired to detect occurrences in which some
    subset of the variables achieve particular values. finally, it
    is supposed that the problem involves the detection of a large
    number of combined occurrences for a large number of changes of
    values of variables. two efficient solutions for this problem
    are described. both methods have the unusual property of being
    faster for systems where the sum p1 + ... + pn is larger. the
    first solution is error-free and suitable for most cases. the
    second solution is slightly more elegant and allows negation as
    well as conjunction, but is subject to the possibility of
    errors. an error analysis is given for the second method and an

    and information channels. this analysis of the process leads to
    the conclusion that in research and development laboratories,

    managers can maximise use of human resources through
    manipulation of the communication channels within the

    <text>an application of formac a nonlinear circuit analysis
    problem is stated and the way in which it was solved using
    formac is indicated. the solution of the problem using formac
    was notable since several other methods that were tried failed.
    the problem is straightforward (although untenable by hand) but
    nevertheless involved an elaborate use of the formac language.
    the program was fairly large and utilized practically every
    command. in particular, it made extensive use of the part
    command. several tricks were necessary in order to circumvent
    some of the shortcomings of the formac system. this paper is
    more concerned with the use of programming techniques in formac
    than with the actual engineering problem, although readers may
    be interested in the problem because it is stated in a general
    (mathematical) sense and could be of interest in areas other
    than circuit analysis. march, 1967 neidleman, l. d. ca670306 jb

    <text>on some problems of subject cataloguing at the wismar
    college of engineering library. the wismar college of
    engineering library uses a classified catalogue for subject
    cataloguing which was introduced in 1970. it is based on the
    hierarchic universal classification system of the rostock
    university library. this is suitable for the stock of the
    wismar library which covers a very wide range of subjects. the
    systematic catalogue has a flexible notation system which can
    cover complex terms extending to 6 columns and also has
    keywords' general, geographical, chronological, linguistic and
    literature. the systematics work at the wismar library has
    several objectives' to adapt the rostock university library's
    universal classification to the specialised wismar collection;
    to overcome the problems arising from scientific developments
    by expanding and bringing up to date the schedules; and to work
    out new systems in cases where the limits of existing ones are
    reached. where this has been necessary 2 c atalogues have
    sometimes been in existence simultaneously to avoid loss of

    <text>a new method of analysing ionospheric movement records
    technique based on optical diffraction systems is outlined the

    the image of a ground transmitter in it is regarded as a source
    of coherent radiation giving rise to a diffraction pattern on
    the ground corresponding to an inhomogeneity moving in or below
    the ionosphere from the geometry of the system a focal length
    is deduced and when the record of the diffraction pattern is
    converted into a variable density photographic record a
    corresponding visual focal length is obtained from which the
    velocity of the moving inhomogeneity can be determined the
    method has been tried at the new zealand dominion physical
    laboratory using aerials arranged at the corners of a triangle
    as suggested by mitra holograms showing some results are
    reproduced from these it is celar that moving objects far below

    <text>a cell organized raster display for line drawings raster
    scan computer graphics displays with "real time" character
    generators have previously been limited to alphanumeric
    characters. a display is described which extends the
    capabilities of this organization to include general graphics.
    the feasibility of such a display is shown by deriving the
    minimum number of patterns required in the read only memory of
    the character generator to synthesize an arbitrary line. the
    synthesis process does not compromise picture quality since the
    resulting dot patterns are identical with those of a
    conventional raster display. furthermore, the time constraints
    of a raster display are shown to be satisfied for a typical
    design for very complex line drawings. february, 1974 jordan,

    probability not only because of the temporal distance between
    their preparation and consultation, but because they can never
    be verified, except after a great time lag. the problem is
    always the search for formulae for references providing the

    <text>bulgarian and foreign literature on energy in the
    people's republic of bulgaria. a critical appraisal of
    literature on energy, available at present, in bulgarian
    libraries. all possible aspects are covered. foreign
    publications in this important field were predominantly french
    and german in the 1940s, but nowadays, 60% is written in
    russian followed by materials in english. during the past 20
    years, even the central regional libraries have established
    special collections on energy. major libraries have specialised
    in 3 areas. firstly, the central technical library and the
    library of the bulgarian academy of sciences have built up
    theoretical collections and others of specialist interest, e.g.
    on nuclear energy. secondly, reference publications are to be
    found mainly at the cyril and methodius national library while
    thirdly technical colleges and other establishments of higher
    technical education concentrate on all aspects of electrical
    power, installations, instruments, and so on. in all libraries,
    the staff responsible for new acquisitions must bear in mind
    the latest trends, e.g. conversion of chemical energy into
    light, where, so far, the literature available is almost
    negligible.</text>

    adaptations of rak to specific types of libraries such as
    rak-wb (wissenschaftliche bibliotheken) academic libraries or
    rak-ob (offentliche bibliotheken) public libraries. this was
    also the case in east germany where adaptations of rak for
    public libraries, research libraries and union libraries were
    published. literature is available explaining in detail the use
    of rak in certain subject areas such as law, biblical

    must help all handicapped people; germany is ahead of france in
    library work with the physically handicapped and provision of
    library facilities for foreign workers certainly involves both
    culture and politics. the libraries must promote reading, or
    books may be ousted by audio-visual media. stock selection
    criteria must be those of truth and objectivity; the librarian
    must be mindful of all viewpoints, since freedom permits

    <text>determination of the intersection points of two plane

    curves. the theory of singular points off a system of two
    differential equations is used in developing the method. the
    intersection point to be determined is identified with such a
    singular point and appropriate modifications are applied to the
    system to ensure that the singular point be stable, i.e. all
    integrals which start in the neighborhood of the singular point
    will always approach this point if the integral parameter tends
    to infinity. in addition a method is described for
    systematically searching for all intersection points in a
    prescribed rectangular area. july, 1968 kuiken, h. k. plane

    for incorporating random number generators directly in fortran

    advantages are speed (avoiding linkage to and from a
    subroutine), convenience, and versatility. anyone wishing to
    experiment with generators, either using congruential

    psychological factors not yet fully explored. staff may feel
    ruled by the machine unless encouraged to understand the system
    thoroughly and take part in organising work processes. in
    setting up samkat at the danish national library, cataloguers
    have been fully involved in the 1st (cataloguing) stage, and

    <text>as american as hamburgers and apple pie. sums up the
    impressions of automation in us libraries. most larger library
    systems have now automated their technical processes, but
    automation of the more complicated bibliographic routines, such
    as literature searching which necessitate uniform and well
    developed cataloguing, is not widespread. the process of
    automation started in the 60s spurred largely by the general us
    openness towards technological developments and pressure from
    commercial firms. the lack of interlibrary cooperation and of
    standardisation of work routines in us public libraries has
    encouraged the adoption of automation systems tailor-made to
    individual libraries. the general impact of automation has not
    been much studied, but there was agreement that computer
    technology had led to centralisation, less independence for
    branches, better interlending, and had freed resources for
    other services. although fewer staff tended to be employed,
    none had been directly made redundant. no cost-benefit analyses
    seemed to have been carried out. the reactions of users, both
    staff and readers, were largely favourable, except perhaps in
    branch public libraries.</text>

    firstly, there were often discrepancies between holdings listed
    in the catalogue and actual collections, which only a
    first-hand check of each issue could rectify. moreover, the
    catalogue is not a satisfactory source for changes of editors,
    managers-or even subtitles and other titles (often appearing in
