    containing information on glues and gluing is a difficult task
    as there are several classes within the udc system with almost
    identical meaning. the scientific research institute for
    technical and economical investigations in chemistry carried
    out an analysis of the udc classes available for classification
    of glues and gluing processes and prepared recommendations on

    (a.s. pushkin museum-preserve) is a literary mecca in june on
    pushkin's name-day. poems are read and songs performed in his
    honour. librarians should help readers to appreciate pushkin's
    poetry. the regional library could compile a work on pushkin
    based on the museum's visitors' books, dating from 1899.
    readers could be encouraged to describe how they discovered
    pushkin. pushkin literary evenings should treat only one of his
    works and adapt to the audience's age group. for these,
    librarians could study variants of his poems, the social life
    and popular culture of his time. the pushkinogorets regional
    library should become a repository of pushkin area legends. the
    museum strives to encourage a lively perception of

    use of uniform titles, and explains how a uniform title is
    selected and its preferred form is determined. a discussion of
    the decision to use a uniform title includes a definition and

    <text>database communication in a heterogenous database
    management system network. an architectural approach is
    outlined, to fulfil the need for an integrated data base
    communication system able to support any user in any network
    node, without incurring mass migration of data. a global query
    translator processes queries into a global conceptual model of
    information content, and a global internal model of data to
    form an access-path oriented model of the structure of the
    integrated system. sub-queries are formed using a query
    decomposer and access path selectors, and are translated into
    the data base language. the role of layers and mappings in the
    proposed architecture is defined between the virtual model and
    the local physical data base. the entity-relationship and
    diam-sddt models are described and compared with general data
    base management systems. an example of an integrated network
    heterogenous data base is followed by a description of
    inter-data base relationships in the unified global conceptual

    questions were raised then as to whether it could operate as a

    fees or overt competition for executive positions. its aims
    include the encouragement of library development, library
    projects and liaison within the pacific region, and to provide
    a communication channel for project workers and working groups.
    although it can operate on its present lines, scopal really
    embodies a 'spirit of regionalism' which from time to time
    motivates cooperation between individuals. its weakness is the
    lack of communication between its members. the spirit of
    regional information cooperation must take flesh in order to be

    <text>progressive acyclic digraphs-a tool for database
    integrity a progressive acyclic digraph (pad) algorithm accepts
    are requests and maintains a graph in an acyclic state. when a
    request creates a cycle, nodes are, "detached" until the new
    are can be entered acyclically this process is important in
    certain areas of database implementation in which there are
    constraints on the permissible sequences of actions. two pad
    algorithms are presented; one uses a simple path matrix
    representation and the other uses a list with an "artificial
    gradient." experiments suggest that for large n the second is
    considerably faster, though both are asymptotically o(nr),
    where n is the number of nodes and r is the expected number of
    nodes reachable along paths from any given node. september,

    <text>buffer allocation in merge-sorting a fixed buffer
    allocation for merge-sorting is presented here which minimizes
    the number of input-output operations for a given order of
    merge. when sorting on movable arm disks, the number of seeks
    is equal to the number of input-output operations, and the seek
    time usually controls the sort time. first some standard
    terminology is introduced. then the input buffer allocation
    method is described, followed by an analysis of the improvement
    to be expected over more conventional allocation. this analysis
    makes use of a particular distribution function. an analysis of
    a completely different distribution is given which yields
    similar results. this suggests that the results do not depend
    on a particular distribution function. an optimum output buffer
    size is also determined. it is concluded that this buffering
    allocation can significantly reduce the time of merge sorting
    on movable arm disks when the input data are not random, and
    that this output buffer allocation should be used whether the
    data is random or not. july, 1971 ferguson, d. e. file, item,

    <text>implications of structured programming for machine
    architecture based on an empirical study of more than 10,000
    lines of program text written in a goto-less language, a
    machine architecture specifically designed for structured
    programs is proposed. since assignment, call, return, and if
    statements together account for 93 percent of all executable
    statements, special care is given to ensure that these
    statements can be implemented efficiently. a highly compact
    instruction encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce
    program size by a factor of 3. unlike a huffman code, which
    utilizes variable length fields, this method uses only fixed
    length (1-byte) op code and address fields. the most frequent
    instructions consist of a single 1-byte field. as a
    consequence, instruction decoding time is minimized, and the
    machine is efficient with respect to both space and time.

    and is still housed in the original building which is now
    protected as a listed building. in the 1950s some interior
    structural alterations were made to improve the general
    efficiency of the library. from 1959 to 1978 various plans were
    made for new university library buildings. these included an
    extension to the library in part of the old town of heidelberg,
    a new building on a new site to serve the medical and
    scientific faculties and small extensions for extra storage.
    finally due to planning restrictions in the old town and the
    1966/67 recession the library remained as it was with temporary
    use of a medical institute building which involves transport
    problems between the 2 sites.</text>

    <text>in line to get on line. in jan 80, an ad hoc consortium
    of some 30 small to medium-sized college and university
    libraries was formed to investigate the development of a
    replicatable on-line public access catalogue. the group, condoc
    (consortium to develop an on-line catalog), came into existence
    because many smaller academic libraries saw their on-line
    catalogue requirements as different to those of large research
    libraries. condoc allowed the pooling of expertise. its 1st

    <text>productivity of multiprogrammed computers-progress in
    developing an analytic prediction method multiprogramming as it
    is discussed here is a mode of computer operation in which two
    or more programs are concurrently in processor memory and
    proceeding, each using the same central processor unit (cpu)
    and input-output (i/o) channels. these programs are actually
    proceeding intermittently and singly, according to eligibility
    (readiness to proceed) and priority. it is useful to be able to
    represent them as proceeding continuously and simultaneously,
    each at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of that
    which it would enjoy in the absence of the other programs. the
    effective progress rate of each program is sensitive to many
    detailed characteristics of itself and its co-residents and
    simulation has been the best available method of predicting it.
    this paper presents the results of progress in developing an
    alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative
    computation of these rates under certain situations. the
    algorithm is sensitive to most of the factors that control the
    phenomenon, including nonquantitative or topological features
    of the programs' structures. december, 1969 lasser, d. j.

    <text>one way of estimating frequencies of jumps in a program
    for the segmentation of a program it is useful to have a
    reasonable estimation of the values of s(ij), where s(ij) is
    the mean value of the number of jumps from the i-th instruction
    on to the j-th instruction in the run time. in the cases where
    the s(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the whole
    program must be generally taken into account; therefore it is
    very difficult for the programmer and/or the translator to
    obtain a good estimation of the s(ij). it is easier to estimate
    not s(ij) but the quantities p(ij)=s(ij)*c(i)/sum[s(ij),
    j=1,n], where c(i) is an arbitrary positive constant for each
    i. although the p(ij) are, for each i, proportional to s(ij),
    the estimation of p(ij) is easier, because we must estimate
    only the "probabilities" of events where instruction i is
    executed after instruction i(i). this estimation can often be
    done without considering the structure of the whole program. in
    the first part of the paper, using the theory of the markov
    chains, an algorithm for the computation of the s(ij) from the
    p(ij) is found, and some ways of obtaining estimates of the
    p(ij) are given. in the second part a variant of this algorithm
    is derived, avoiding the necessity of computation involving
    large matrices. july, 1968 kral, j. object program reduction,

    <text>professionalism in the computing field the term
    professional means different things to different people;
    nevertheless, there are certain general technical and social
    standards normally associated with a professional. further, the
    term is more generally applied to the practitioner rather than
    to the researcher. but within the rather broad definition
    specified, the computing practitioner is, as yet, not regarded
    as a professional. each of the four types of
    institutions-academic, industry, government, and the
    professional society- that educate, employ, regulate, and mold
    the practitioner contributes to the "nonprofessional" status of
    the computing practitioner. the roles of these institutions are
    examined, various shortcomings are noted, and recommended
    changes are suggested. in the last analysis, professional
    status is not bestowed; it is earned. however, universities and
    industry, specifically, can make certain improvements to help
    the computing practitioner achieve professional status.

    leipzig. the library, founded in 1894, has taken over all
    selection, production, presentation and sales of literature for
    the blind and partially sighted in east germany. loan stocks
    include about 7,000 books and 6,000 scores in braille and over
    3,000 talking books. more than 1,000 titles are available for
    sale. generally users prefer non-fiction in braille and fiction
    on tape or cassette. many of the 2,000 regular users become
    blind when elderly, so they prefer talking books to braille.
    monthly lists of new additions to stock are published.
    information on new children's books is sent to parents and
    information on large print books to libraries and old people's
    homes. close cooperation is maintained with other organisations
    in this field, especially with schools for the blind and much

    critique of the first three systems is based on actual
    experience with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program;
    a short history and description of this program is presented. a
    standardization of minimum capabilities for loaders is
    recommended so that programs which must operate under more than
    one computer system may be easily converted and maintained. a
    proposal that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation
    specification concept instead of the conditional tree structure
    is delineated. this concept provides more efficient and
    cost-effective utilization of the memory as well as increased

    <text>the plannable and unplannable (ii)' libraries as the
    infrastructure of preservation and change. lecture given at the
    annual conference of the german library association and the
    association of librarians in north rhine-westphalia, bielefeld,
    oct 80. (for part 1, 2see1 previous abstract). libraries exist
    to fulfil human needs for education, information, communication
    and general self-development. future library planning must pay
    more attention to the balance of stationary and mobile elements
    in a system, to local needs and to adult education. both
    qualified librarians and voluntary helpers can make valuable
    contributions to library services; staff of high calibre are
    more important than the media themselves or advanced technical
    equipment. too much technology in a library can alienate the
    readers. it is difficult to generalise about minimum standards;
    each library needs its own identity.</text>

    paper presented at library history seminar vi 'libraries &amp;

    to the culture within which they exist-providing a repository
    of what has been discovered, imagined or hoped, and serving as
    arenas within which people can grapple with present tasks and
    attempt to cope with the future. presents a brief historical
    review of the us library's role in cultural life, and
    highlights present and likely future difficulties in meeting
    that goal, as libraries are faced with inflationary pressures,
    the public's increasing use of television instead of books, and

    computer diagnosis of clinical electrocardiograms. it seems
    likely that efforts of this sort will lead to a satisfactory
    solution to the problem of the automatic diagnosis of
    electrocardiograms. current attempts by the authors to extend
    the diagnostic capabilities of the present system are
    particularly concerned with increasing the fidelity of the
    adaptive matched filters, the development of three dimensional
    pattern analysis, the analysis of parallel
    electrocardiographer-computer diagnostic interaction, and a
    study of the possibility of introducing major, tree-like

    part of 1979 and 80. the survey population was selected from
    the 3 melbourne university libraries and 3 of the larger
    colleges of advanced education libraries. interviews were
    designed to provide information about attitudes to reference
    provision, and questionnaires sought to measure respondents'
    attitudes towards specific reference services as expressed by
    the acceptance or rejection of an opinion of such a service.

    subscription cost and price per page. the 85 articles, which
    appeared in these issues, were analysed by subject matter, type
    of library described and characteristics of authors. concludes
    that one trend, is towards fewer articles occupying a smaller
    fraction of the total number of pages and the subjects are less
    concerned with library materials and administration and more
    concerned with professional organisations. another trend is
    towards a greater emphasis on advertisements and book

    the working-set concept is extended for programs that reference

    (gws) keeps as its resident set those segments whose retention
    costs do not exceed their retrieval costs. the gws is a model
    for the entire class of demand-fetching memory policies that
    satisfy a resident-set inclusion property. a generalized
    optimal policy (gopt) is also defined; at its operating points
    it minimizes aggregated retention and swapping costs. special
    cases of the cost structure allow gws and gopt to simulate any
    known stack algorithm, the working set, and vmin. efficient
    procedures for computing demand curves showing swapping load as
    a function of memory usage are developed for gws and gopt
    policies. empirical data from an actual system are included.

    libraries must share data about serials. standards are a
    pre-requisite to sharing data-a standard definition of a
    serial, the issn, the marc format, standards for holdings
    statements and library symbols and cataloguing standards. use

    services board act was passed which led to the national central
    library in dar es salaam being built in 1967. the library
    started with a stock of 136,000 and is the headquarters of the
    tanzania library services. from this centre other libraries
    were planned, firstly in the district towns, then on a smaller
    scale in rural areas. converted lorries served as mobile
    libraries in rural areas at first. the total stock of public
    libraries still only totals 900,000 for a population of
    17,000,000. a university library was founded in dar es salaam
    in 1961. at present complete training facilities for library

    <text>an algorithm for the blocks and cutnodes of a graph an

    of an arbitrary undirected graph. the graph may be represented
    either (i) as an ordered list of edges or (ii) as a packed
    adjacency matrix. if w denotes the word length of the machine
    employed, the storage (in machine words) required for a graph
    with n nodes and m edges increases essentially as 2(m+n) in
    case (i), or (n^2)/win case (ii). a spanning tree with labeled
    edges is grown, two edges finally bearing different labels if
    and only if they belong to different blocks. for both
    representations the time required to analyze a graph on n nodes
    increases as n^g where g depends on the type of graph, 1 &lt;=

    <text>a proposal to establish a pseudo virtual memory via
    writable overlays many computer systems solve executable
    storage size problems for large programs by using overlays.
    however, it appears that no one overlay scheme contains a
    well-balanced combination of the most useful capabilities which
    are found in various existing techniques. a proposal is
    presented which utilizes several of the best capabilities from
    existing schemes and is complemented by several additional
    features, e.g. writable overlays. the writable overlay
    capability provides a virtual memory effect, although the
    programmer may still be required to design the overlay
    configuration. since overlay structuring is a complex task,
    several tools (including a graphic display) are included in the
    proposal in order to aid the programmer in the design. the
    content of overlays is briefly discussed, and it is noted that
    many of the details of the final overlay configuration may be
    decided after the fact. june, 1972 spacek, t. r. overlay,

    public libraries. at present libraries in bulgaria, as
    elsewhere, have to compete with mass media, in particular with
    television. migration of young people to towns hampers
    expansion of libraries in rural areas. people buy more books
    and use public libraries less than in the past. in spite of
    this as well as some other negative factors, interest in
    reading has increased recently and the population's leisure
    time activities have become more balanced. thus the staff in
    local public and central regional libraries have to plan
    carefully to attract new readers. all ages and social groups
    must be catered for. in addition to books, special printed
    material, such as sheet-music and reproduction of paintings,
    must be more fully used.</text>

    <text>experiments with a deductive question-answering program
    as an investigation in artificial intelligence, computer
    experiments on deductive question-answering were run with a
    lisp program called deducom, an acronym for deductive
    communicator. when given 68 facts, deducom answered 10
    questions answerable from the facts. a fact tells deducom
    either some specific information or a method of answering a
    general kind of question. some conclusions drawn in the article
    are: (1) deducom can answer a wide variety of questions. (2) a
    human can increase the deductive power of deducom by telling it
    more facts. (3) deducom can write very simple programs (it is
    hoped that this ability is the forerunner of an ability to
    self-program, which is a way to learn). (4)deducom's search
    procedure at present has two bad defects: some questions
    answerable from the given facts cannot be answered and some
    other answerable questions can be answered only if the relevant
    facts are given in the "right" order. (6) at present, deducom's
    method of making logical deductions in predicate calculus has
    two bad defects: some facts have to be changed to logically
    equivalent ones before being given to deducom, and some
    redundant facts have to be given to deducom. december, 1965

    large extent schedule its own workload. the scheduling routine
    must be capable of extremely rapid execution if it is not to
    prove self-defeating. the construction of a schedule entails
    determining which programs are to be run concurrently and which
    sequentially with respect to each other. a concise scheduling
    algorithm is described which tends to minimize the time for
    executing the entire pending workload (or any subset of it),
    subject to external constraints such as precedence, urgency,
    etc. the algorithm is applicable to a wide class of machines.

    <text>on the optimal detection of curves in noisy pictures a
    technique for recognizing systems of lines is presented. in
    this technique the heuristic of the problem is not embedded in
    the recognition algorithm but is expressed in a figure of
    merit. a multistage decision process is then able to recognize
    in the input picture the optimal system of lines according to
    the given figure of merit. due to the global approach, greater
    flexibility and adequacy in the particular problem is achieved.
    the relation between the structure of the figure of merit and
    the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.
    the method described is suitable for parallel processing
    because the operations relative to each state can be computed
    in parallel, and the number of stages is equal to the length n
    of the curves (or to log2 n if the approximate method is used).

    <text>people should broaden their outlook: some observations on
    the 'narrow' catchword. librarians still cope badly with the
    principle of the narrow catchword because their terminological
    control is still ineffective. the narrow catchword uses precise
    terminology and separates related material; the broad catchword
    covers wide subject areas and tends to result in the formation
    of hierarchies of subordinated groups. die deutsche bibliothek
    (german national library) uses mainly narrow catchwords,
    equating this with precise subject classification but
    occasionally deviations from this principle occur. catchwords
    in some subject areas are narrower than in others. terminology
    is carefully controlled and this is essential when precise
    terms are used. if precise subject definition and strict
    terminology control are closely linked then it follows that
    precise subject definition can only be carried out in the
    user's interest when sufficient numbers of well-trained staff
    are available.</text>

    <text>public library boards: an exploration of their viability
    in library governance. whilst library boards have for a long
    time governed us public libraries, they are riddled with
    problems, but few librarians are willing to publicise their
    dissatisfaction with present board-librarian relationships.
    briefly surveys the history of library boards and their present
    modus operandi. summarises research findings on library boards.
    main findings indicate that there is a serious lack of
    communication between librarian and trustee; boards tend to be
    advisory only; and there is a trend towards maintenance of
    traditional library boards-but boards must be more
    representative of communities, a move that would broaden their

    <text>a long farewell to 'narrow' catchwords. the use of
    'narrow' catchwords as a principle element in catchword
    catalogues is no longer acceptable. the term 'narrow' is too
    vague and does not convey the content and meaning which it
    should. the principle of the 'narrow' catchword has always been
    regarded as defining a classification method; this is however,
    not the case. libraries would be advised to conform with
    standard terminology used in documentation and information
    science and to avoid further use of the 'narrow' catchword or
    'narrow' term. the control of classification terminology is a
    very important area of library science which should be more
    clearly defined. examining such terms as the principle of the
    'narrow' catchword is, therefore, 1 step towards eliminating
    terminology which has no real meaning or use.</text>

    from 1 kind of library to another. in some universities,

    <text>symbolic integration: the stormy decade three approaches
    to symbolic integration in the 1960's are described. the first,
    from artificial intelligence, led to slagle's saint and to a
    large degree to moses' sin. the second, from algebraic
    manipulation, led to manove's implementation and to horowitz'
    and tobey's reexamination of the hermite algorithm for
    integrating rational functions. the third, from mathematics,
    led to richardson's proof of the unsolvability of the problem
    for a class of functions and for risch's decision procedure for
    the elementary functions.generalizations of risch's algorithm
    to a class of special functions and programs for solving
    differential equations and for finding the definite integral
    are also described. august, 1971 moses, j. integration,

    <text>ionization distribution in the f region the height
    distribution of ionization in the composite f region is
    calculated on the assumptions that the scale height ie the
    temperature increases and the recombination coefficient
    decreases with height in this region the recombination
    coefficient is assumed to vary in terms of the reduced height
    that is the height above f max measured in terms of the actual
    height as had been done earlier by ap mitra in making similar
    calculations the present assumption automatically takes into
    account the effect of rising temperature on the value of the
    recombination coefficient height distribution curves for high
    and low latitude stations are drawn for typical summer and
    winter conditions in the high atmosphere in the f region when
    the possible effect of ionospheric tidal drifts are taken into
    account the forms of the distribution curves and the separation
    between the f and f layers agree with those deduced from
    observations the results support the view that the f and f
    layers belong to a common bank of ionization produced by solar

    <text>time-education-information: discussion needed so that the
    school library can function. conclusions from a scandinavian
    school librarians' conference held at leangkollen, norway, july
    80, included the school library's all-embracing function; the
    pre-eminence of danish school libraries in scandinavia; the
    need for norwegian authorities to carry out the intentions of
    the library act; and school libraries' important role in
    scandinavian cultural cooperation. topics included a forward
    view of the school's aims and curriculum; the challenge of
    supplying suitable education for each individual child in the
    1980s; the staffing question, teacher training being seen as
    more valuable than advanced library studies; the new term
    'media centre', aptly describing the true function of a school
    library; and fairy tales in education. the school library is an
    important aid towards learning other scandinavian languages at
    the earliest possible age. essentials in norway are: a
    sufficient allowance of time for the school librarian in the
    curriculum; adequate education for school librarians; and
    information and discussion on the norwegian school library
    system.</text>

    <text>does trondheim need a public library? open letter to the
    party members in the town council. the staff of trondheim
    public library, norway, consider the latest postponement (till
    after 1982) of the planned new library totally irresponsible.
    having long tolerated unsatisfactory conditions in the
    expectation of improvement, they now demand that the present
    library should be brought up to current standards of health and
    work environment conditions, though even this would not meet
    the needs of the local community. much of the bookstock is
    housed elsewhere for lack of space, which together with staff
    shortages makes for unsatisfactory public service. it is
    impossible to extend services to the elderly, handicapped and
    other disadvantaged groups. only a new library can bring
    trondheim into line with other norwegian city library
    services.</text>

    <text>library networking in australia' the past is future.
    takes a critical look at proposals by the national library of
    australia to produce a national bibliography network (abn). the
    licence for a software package, developed and implemented at

    network, was acquired in 1980 after considerable testing. puts
    the proposals in the broader context in which they are set.
    they system has 4 main components' on-line union catalogue;
    on-line bibliographic source file; catalogue processing; and

    systems which currently are critically dependent on property

    employing a deliberate sequence of significance tests within

    design to study the impact of the programme on service demand,
    the results are evaluated with respect to several economic and
    evaluative performance critera. while such a user-charge policy

    <text>cai-one response to on-line users' instructional needs.
    contribution to a thematic issue on on-line technology. surveys
    the current on-line bibliographic environment in north america,
    with its multiplicity of available data bases and variability
    in searching software. points out the need for end-user
    education in order to exploit the potential of automated
    retrieval, and sees computer assisted instruction (cai) as one
    of the best mediums to use for doing this. discusses the
    educational role of cai in libraries, and gives some examples
    of its use. forecasts some future developments in cai, and
    stresses the need to develop appropriate instructional material

    <text>staffing for reader services in polytechnic libraries.
    (mls dissertation). 5 uk polytechnic libraries (at manchester,

    surveyed with special reference to the influence of multi-site
    operation on the effectiveness of reader services. the
    libraries placed much emphasis on the role of subject
    specialists in maintaining good user relations. all found it
    easier to build up such relations in smallsite rather than
    large central libraries. opinions and policies concerning
    subject specialist duties varied. alternatives to subject
    specialist systems were not favoured. financial constraints
    were having a profound effect on the efforts of polytechnics to

    <text>outline of a society of freely available information.
    today technological innovations in many fields cause social
    changes almost before society has become aware of their
    existence. very often negative influences of certain
    innovations have not been thoroughly investigated beforehand.
    this has led to the growth of many counter movements in
    society. it is necessary to find common ground between
    representatives of 'established' and 'alternative' styles of
    living, in order to ensure the continuation of innovation in
    society. initiative, creativity and cooperation, the vital
    factors for technological and economic innovation, are evident
    in both groups, only opinions as to the best means of employing
    them differ. today a new electronic information network is
    gradually linking mankind. the world is becoming a 'global
    village' at least on the level of technological communications
    structures. this network may enable us to progress to a
    rational world model in which everyone will have a chance in
    life.</text>

    <text>the combined use of bibliographic coupling and cocitation

    and their cocitations (both cited and citing papers) produced
    improved document retrieval over a measure based only on
    bibliographic coupling. the test collection consisted of 1,712

    measure to the linkage similarity measure, representing the

    information or on the basis of size and contrast. a scheme is
    presented which performs eliminations on the basis of local
    properties of the region adjacency graph. the scheme is based
    on definitions of graph properties which are satisfied when a
    spurious region is present; then editing is equivalent to fast
    graph operations. a number of examples are shown. april, 1977

    the school of library service, dalhousie university, halifax,

    for library education within canada's atlantic provinces. a
    pragmatic educational approach encourages students to work with
    books as material objects, with courses in printing history,
    bookbinding and preservation. the school's emphasis on the

    <text>global optimization by suppression of partial
    redundancies the elimination of redundant computations and the
    moving of invariant computations out of loops are often done
    separately, with invariants moved outward loop by loop. we
    propose to do both at once and to move each expression directly
    to the entrance of the outermost loop in which it is invariant.
    this is done by solving a more general problem, i.e. the
    elimination of computations performed twice on a given
    execution path. such computations are termed partially
    redundant. moreover, the algorithm does not require any
    graphical information or restrictions on the shape of the
    program graph. testing this algorithm has shown that its
    execution cost is nearly linear with the size of the program,
    and that it leads to a smaller optimizer that requires less
    execution time. february, 1979 morel, e. renvoise, c.

    <text>the effect of noise on the frequency stability of a
    linear oscillator the standard conditions for a sinusoidal
    oscillation are that the attenuation and net phase shift around
    the closed loop be zero random fluctuations are relied upon to
    start the oscillation if the level of oscillation is to remain
    finite in the continued presence of noise the oscillating loop
    must hav some attenuation and functions like a highly
    regenerative amplifier with a loop gain very nearly unity
    accordingly the oscillator produces not a single frequency but
    rather a narrow band of noise that causes instability in the
    magnitude and in the apparent frequency of the output thes
    instabilities are discussed for oscillators in which all
    elements are linear except for some slow acting amplitude
    control the bandwidth of the noisy oscillation can be predicted
    from easily measured system characteristics several methods of
    defining the frequency of the output are considered with
    special reference to precision measurements in general the
    measured frequency departs from the zero phase shift criterion
    and is dependent on the measuring equipment methods of
    minimizing instabilities due to noise are investigated</text>

    <text>theoretical approaches to information retrieval. presents
    the results of research conducted during a visiting fellowship,
    mar 80-mar 81, on the following topics' retrieval methods of
    documents indexed by weighted index terms; similarity measures
    for boolean search request formulations and their applications;
    document-clustering-based information retrieval and document
    clustering utilising previously formed query clusters; and a
    probabilistic approach to information retrieval in systems with
    boolean search request formulations. a number of information
    retrieval techniques applicable in systems based on boolean
    searches have been introduced. special attention has been paid
    to incorporate into the standard boolean retrieval schemes a
    weighting mechanism to produce ranked lists of documents.
    several alternative approaches have been offered which are
    based on results of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic,
    probability theory and decision analysis, and the theory of
    boolean functions.</text>

    <text>classification and subject indication' highlights of the
    anglo-american debate, 1850-1950. discusses the development of
    uk and us ideas on subject headings and classification from the
    time of panizzi's challenge to classified cataloguing through
    the practical approach of cutter and hulme to the work of
    bliss. cutter and hulme never fully developed their practical
    approach, leaving the way clear for the theoretical
    classificationists such as otlet and richardson. universal
    decimal classification was the manifestation of their
    principles and also the beginning of a decisive historical
    movement that culminates in the work of bliss. his great value
    is that he offers an independent perspective on the history of
    classification and subject indication and is reasonably
    encouraging about colon classification, the system that ended
    the formative classificationist period in anglo-american
    thought.</text>

    <text>an encoding method for multifield sorting and indexing
    sequences of character strings with an order relation imposed
    between sequences are considered. an encoding scheme is
    described which produces a single, order-preserving string from
    a sequence of strings. the original sequence can be recovered
    from the encoded string, and one sequence of strings precedes
    another if and only if the encoding of the first precedes the
    encoding of the second. the strings may be variable length,
    without a maximum length restriction, and no symbols need be
    reserved for control purposes. hence any symbol may occur in
    any string. the scheme is useful for multifield sorting,
    multifield indexing, and other applications where ordering on
    more than one field is important. november, 1977 blasgen, m. w.

    <text>a model for type checking most current programming
    languages treat computation over different classes of objects
    (e.g. numbers, strings, labels and functions). for correct
    compilation and execution, the following question then arises:
    is a program properly constructed so that its operations and
    operands are compatible? the activity of answering this
    question is usually called type checking. this paper attempts
    to isolate the notion of type checking and presents a partial
    solution to the type checking problem based on the notions of
    abstraction and application of functions. in particular, a
    program is mapped into an expression within a decidable subset
    of the lambda calculus, which characterizes the type relations
    within the program and eliminates all other information. the
    determination of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness of
    the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding lambda
    calculus expression to one of two normal forms, the constant
    "correct" for a type-wise correct program or the constant
    "error". an application to type checking in algol 60 is made,
    and the attendant problems faced for any notion of type
    checking are discussed. november, 1972 ledgard, h. f. type

    <text>on the conversion of decision tables to computer programs
    the use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing
    ambiguities in decision tables is discussed. it is pointed out
    that any attempt at resolving ambiguities at compile time will,
    in general, be impossible. it is shown that, as a consequence,
    tree methods of converting decision tables to programs are
    inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection. two algorithms for
    programming decision tables whose merits are simplicity of
    implementation and detection of ambiguities at execution time
    are presented. the first algorithm is for limited entry
    decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding
    of the information in the decision table. the second algorithm
    programs a mixed entry decision table directly without going
    through the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry
    form, thereby resulting in storage economy. a comparison of the
    algorithms and others proposed in the literature is made. some
    features of a decision table to fortran iv translator for the

    an examination of patil's proof shows that he has established
    this claim only under strong restrictions on the use of p and
    v. these restrictions eliminate programming techniques used by
    dijkstra and others since the first introduction of the
    semaphore concept. this paper contains a solution to the
    problem. it also discusses the need for the generalized
    operators suggested by patil. march, 1975 parnas, d. l.

    <text>photography: art form or legal forum?. the increasing

    copyright. careful sifting of legal principles involved with
    photographic matters and adherence to regulated procedures
    reduces the potential liability for vexations claims to

    meeting of the medical library association, washington, d.c.)
    if librarians are to understand their role and participate in
    the life of scholarship, they must be more than record
    custodians or information service managers. there are many
    approaches to this understanding including the historical,
    social, psychological and epistemological. it can also be
    sought through a study of the sociology of knowledge and a
    study of the ways in which changes in communications technology
    in writing and printing have affected scholarship in the past.
    this may also provide a means of preparing for the impact of
    computer technology on the scholarship of the future.</text>

    <text>the provision of medical information in smaller hospitals

    showed that 1/3 of hospitals surveyed had some form of library.
    the provision of library services in dutch hospitals is
    hindered by inadequate bookfunds, staff and accommodation.
    furthermore, in the smaller hospitals doctors are too busy with
    routine work to use library services. smaller hospitals could
    provide medical 'core' libraries of basic textbooks and
    periodicals at minimal cost. such a medical core library was
    formed in 1973 at the princess irene hospital in almelo and by

    <text>revenue sharing and state funding in indiana: prospects
    improve for public libraries. in the early 70s the fiscal
    outlook for indiana's public libraries was abysmally
    depressing, with most libraries having no opportunity to
    participate in the distribution of revenue-sharing funds.
    however, as the decade progressed, several legislative bills
    favourable to public libraries were enacted. these followed the
    revenue sharing act of 1972, which permitted government units
    to appropriate funds only for the purposes for which their own
    revenues were expended. in 1978, revenue-sharing funds
    increased dramatically as a result of the state legislators'
    second attempt to provide public libraries with access to
    revenue-sharing funds, with the passage of senate-enrolled act
    no. 208. the optimistic outlook for the 80s is tempered only by
    the concern of librarians about state legislators' commitment
    to continue state funding of public libraries.</text>

    for scientific typisation of libraries; (2) a number of library
    science disciplines have developed within the framework of
    library science which are based on various differentiation and
    integration principles; (3) theories of special librarianship
    must be built on an analysis of the activities undertaken by

    proved very successful. a 5-point procedure was followed' (1)
    evaluate present operation and various tasks; (2) analyse these
    tasks to detect non-productive areas or areas in need of
    improvement; (3) design a solution; (4) document the new
    procedures; and (5) implement the solution. the procedures
    highlighted the fact that more time was spent in finding
    catalogue copy than in any other task. when this time was cut
    down through the use of the marc distribution service of the

    <text>cat: a 7090-3600 computer-aided translation a
    semi-automatic translation system has been implemented which
    converts 7090 fap language programs into 3600 assembly
    language. the input to the system is a fap program deck which
    has been specially prepared for translation by the user. the
    output consists of the translated compass language program
    together with a comprehensive diagnostic listing which the user
    must analyze in order to verify any questionable areas of the
    translation. the translation processor consists of three
    distinct phases: an assembly of the fap program, a
    comprehensive analysis of the assembled code with particular
    regard to the actions of instructions upon other instructions
    and upon data, and finally the output pass which generates the
    compass program in the form of macro instructions. december,

    <text>effects of chargeout on user/manager attitudes the
    relationship of in ternal pricing systems for computer services

    computer-based information systems is investigated. evidence is
    provided that the relationship conforms to a general pattern
    that would be expected from the hypothesis of the four stages
    of edp growth [15]. the results also indicate that the
    chargeout systems characteristic of advanced edp stage
    environments are associated with relatively high levels of
    positive user attitudes and marked increases in edp training
    for users. both factors are important to the user/manager
    involvement necessary for effective control of computer-based
    systems. development and main tenance of computer-based systems
    is asserted to be a category of organizational change. a "felt
    need" for the change on the part of the user/manager is
    prerequisite to any change taking place. the research methods
    of behavioral science are applied to investigate the
    user/manager environment and the effects of chargeout. march,

    <text>the new math of computer programming structured
    programming has proved to be an important methodology for
    systematic program design and development. structured programs
    are identified as compound function expressions in the algebra
    of functions. the algebraic properties of these function
    expressions permit the reformulation (expansion as well as
    reduction) of a nested subexpression independently of its
    environment, thus modeling what is known as stepwise program
    refinement as well as program execution. finally, structured
    programming is characterized in terms of the selection and
    solution of certain elementary equations defined in the algebra
    of functions. these solutions can be given in general formulas,
    each involving a single parameter, which display the entire
    freedom available in creating correct structured programs.

    <text>consumer difficulties with computerized transactions: an
    empirical investigation the prevalence with which errors may be
    encountered by the end targets of a computerized process is
    assessed. how many and what type of errors occur? how easily
    are they corrected? what is the reaction of consumers to
    errors-to a failure to correct them? what can be learned by
    designers of large management packages from such data? results
    show that with the present state of the art, approximately 40
    percent of individuals (or households) having average contacts
    with different types of accounts experience one or more errors
    per year. eighty percent relate to billing. attempts to correct
    errors often turned out to be difficult and not always
    successful. there appears to be some conflict between
    computer-using organizations and their public. also the role of
    poor man agement packages including poor software is indicated.
    while most management systems may be adequate, results of the
    survey raise concerns about the timeliness and the number of
    designs of very large linked program packages (as eft for

    <text>core collections of journals for national interlending
    purposes. centralised national provision for interlending
    provides a better service than decentralised provision but can
    be difficult and expensive to implement, so partial
    centralisation should be considered. journals are specially
    suited to central collections. concentration of demand on a
    relatively small number of journals means that collections of
    7,000-8,000 titles could supply 80% of demand and 2,000 titles
    50% in many countries. there are however problems in
    identifying journals for core collections. bibliometric methods
    can be shown to be of little help. analysis of demand at the
    british library lending division indicates that rank lists are
    not very stable over time; and various factors such as language
    or stage of economic development will cause variations that
    make it difficult to apply core lists between countries (though
    it may be possible to allow for differences, especially if core
    lists based on current demand could be obtained from a number
    of different countries). once a core collection had been set
    up, it would have to attract sufficient requests to monitor
    demand and adjust its contents accordingly. if a comprehensive
    collection is not possible, limitation to certain subjects has
    advantages. as collections grow, additional journals will be
    cheaper to acquire, though the unit cost per request will still
    be lower for the journals in heaviest demand. concludes that
    the concept of core collections is sound, but further data are
    needed before the practical problems of setting up such
    collections can be properly assessed.</text>

    curve or the use of budgets as a basis for a stage model.
    however, the results do not invalidate the concept of a stage
    model. the analysis suggests an alternative model of budget
    growth and a separation between models of budgeting growth and
    growth stages in the development of the computer resource.

    <text>the state of bibliography in hungary. reviews progress
    made in the compilation of bibliographies in hungary since the
    national working conference on bibliography in 1961 had
    identified large gaps in coverage and the need for
    coordination. the national szechenyi library has made
    considerable efforts to develop an up-to-date system for the
    hungarian national bibliography; the greatest bibliography of
    the period 1921-44. progress in special bibliographies has been
    haphazard with overlap in some fields while certain other
    fields such as mathematics and physics have no current
    bibliographies. it is to be feared that without a coordinating
    body to plan bibliographic activities, it will take a long time
    to have a complete system of bibliographies in hungary.</text>

    standards have an important role in the implementation of new

    relevance in librarianship includes improving reader services,
    maximising use of resources, accounting procedures and
    interlibrary cooperation. in 1976-78 existing standards
    relating to libraries were revised and coordinated and a
    long-term programme of standardisation covering information
    work, librarianship and publishing was initiated. aspects of
    librarianship affected by standards introduced since then
    include' the bibliographical description of music and maps,

    catholic public libraries in this area are administered by st.
    michael's league. the library service, founded at the beginning
    of this century, developed into its present form after 1945. in
    1979, in the whole of bavaria, the league controlled 1,273
    libraries stocking over 3 million media; loans totalled over 6
    million, with over 6,000 staff, mainly volunteers. the parish
    libraries are controlled by diocesan centres which employ
    professional, fulltime staff, provide advice for smaller
    libraries and arrange staff training programmes. the diocesan
    centres are in turn subordinate to the state administrative
    centre in munich, which is responsible for organising central
    purchasing and interloans and publishing a nnual reports,
    statistics and quarterly information sheets. a professional
    journal is published jointly with the borromeus association,
    responsible for roman catholic public libraries outside

    <text>a method of syntax-checking algol 60 a syntax checker was
    designed based on the syntax of algol as described in the algol
    60 report [communications of the acm, may, 1960]. since the
    definition of the elements of the language is recursive it
    seemed most desirable to design the syntax checker as a set of
    mutually recursive processors tied together by subroutines
    which perform certain bookkeeping functions. because of the
    recursive nature of the language and of the syntax checker the
    problem of recovery after an error required much attention. a
    method was devised which permits most programs to be checked
    completely despite errors. august, 1964 lietzke, m. p. ca640805

    <text>introduction to "feature analysis of generalized data
    base management systems" this paper is a separately published
    introduction to a main report which analyzes the features of
    generalized data base management systems. this introduction
    gives a review of the current state of the art in these systems
    and discusses the differences and similarities between
    capabilities found in host language systems and those found in
    self-contained systems. after some discussion of the problems
    of data independence and binding,the four user levels are
    identified and described. technical problems facing future
    designers are described. the first of these is that of handling
    existing stored data and the next is that of providing more
    complex data structures than those already available in
    conventional programming languages. the problem of high level
    interrogation and update functions acting on network structures
    is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the problem of
    catering to a high volume of transactions initiated from
    terminals by parametric users-the lowest level of user. the use
    of cobol as a basis for further development work is considered
    at some length with respect to data structures, host language
    capabilities, and self-contained capabilities. this section
    also assesses the effect of the data base task group proposals.
    the final section outlines the ten major topics in the main
    body of the full report. may, 1971 codasyl systems committee

    <text>a syntactic algorithm for peak detection in waveforms
    with applications to cardiography peaks in a digitized waveform
    are detected by an algorithm incorporating piecewise linear
    approximation and tabular parsing techniques. several
    parameters serve to identify the waveform context enabling
    accurate measurement of peak amplitude, duration, and shape.
    the algorithm is of sufficient speed to allow on-line real-time
    processing. an example of its application is demonstrated on an
    electrocardiogram. may, 1975 horowitz, s. l. peak detection,

    between 1876 and 1917, identifies a collective profile of both
    groups in order to test the hypothesis that the council was

    <text>the merit of regional computing networks one of the
    suggested means for stimulating the spread of computing
    capabilities in institutions of higher learning is through the
    construction of regional computing networks. one such network
    has been constructed in the san francisco bay area by stanford
    university. this paper reports upon the lessons learned from
    the operation of the network over the past two years. a major
    impact of the network was not so much the computer power
    delivered to the schools as the awakening of computing
    awareness and the fostering of capability development at these
    schools. the expertise and assistance from the central facility
    as well as the sharing of ideas among the participants were
    other important benefits. both the quality and variety of
    services provided by the central facility were found to play a
    key role in the effectiveness of the network. a regional
    network brings many benefits and should not be judged as a
    purveyor of raw computer power alone. may, 1971 nielsen, n. r.

    schools and libraries. between 1960 and 1980, after
    independence, the education system was reformed and a literacy
    campaign promoted in the country's 4 main languages. since the
    1970s 46 public libraries have been opened, each of which
    contains a children's department. keypoints in the development
    of children's libraries are the production of suitable
    literature, stock expansion and staff training, a programme
    coordinated by the central library for children's literature in

    using this as a basis, a series of group discussions was
    conducted to give a more detailed picture. the results,

    physical characteristics, are presented graphically. it was
    found that choice was influenced more by aesthetic than by

    <text>the library's administrative body: clear guidelines now!.
    the norwegian government envisages cultural committees as
    administering libraries. individual library committees may
    survive, but as exceptions and in conflict with official
    policy. the library sub-committee is unsatisfactory. a ministry
    of church and education document (1979) outlines division of
    responsibility between librarian and cultural administration.
    librarians must insist on several professional demands. if
    these stipulations are upheld, and guidelines drawn up with the
    support of library organisations, libraries may survive.</text>

    <text>computers and employment the relationship of computers
    and automation to employment is part of the more general
    relation of technological change to employment. the most
    obvious effect is that increase in productivity due to
    technology can eliminate jobs. technology affects the
    individual worker, in the nature and amount of his work, and in
    his attitudes toward that work. technological change affects
    the occupational structure of the entire labor force. because
    of the central importance of these effects, the impact of
    technology has been the subject of extensive study by
    economists, sociologists, political scientists, and
    psychologists. even within a single discipline, studies are
    often contradictory, and conclusions are colored by political
    overtones. we wish to delineate some of the issues, and present
    arguments given to support different viewpoints. july, 1972

    <text>citation rates to technologically important patents. the
    purpose of this study was to determine whether the average
    number of citations received by issued us patents from
    subsequently issued us patents is higher for patents associated
    with important technological advances than for a group of
    randomly selected patents. analysis of examiners' citations to
    100 selected patents showed that these selected patents, which
    underlay technically important products, were more than twice
    as frequently cited as a randomly selected set of 102 control
    patents. this finding provides strong evidence for the
    hypothesis that patent citation data can be used in
    technological indicators development, and in technological
    policy analysis, since it implies that the location and
    analysis of groups of highly cited patents can provide a valid
    indicator of patent areas of technical importance.</text>

    <text>optimal shift strategy for a block-transfer ccd memory
    for the purposes of this paper, a block-transfer ccd memory is
    composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary,
    but which have a definite minimum shift rate (the refresh rate)
    and a definite maximum shift rate. the bits iin the shift
    registers are numbered 0 to n - 1, and blocks of n bits are
    always transferred, always starting at bit 0. what is the best
    shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a
    random time will have to wait the minimal amount of time before
    bit 0 can be reached? the minimum shift rate requirement does
    not allow one to simply "park" at bit 0 and wait for a transfer
    request. the optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly as
    possible until bit 0 is passed, then shifting as quickly as
    possible until a critical boundary is reached, shortly before
    bit 0 comes around again. this is called the "hurry up and
    wait" strategy and is well known outside the computer field.
    the block-transfer ccd memory can also be viewed as a paging
    drum with a variable (bounded) rotation speed. may,1978 sites,

    following lenin's exhortation that every citizen should have a
    library within 1.5-2 km from his place of residence, library
    services in 3 rural districts in the mountainous part of the
    vraca region are reviewed. there are about 36 localities and
    villages there, but only 3 of them have more than 2,500
    inhabitants. in spite of good public transport, provision must
    be made for people working in remote mines and on sheep farms.
    book collections in local public libraries range from
    3,000-6,000 volumes. at present annual acquisitions are on
    average 4.5 volumes per capita, against only 0.49 volume in
    1954. the target is 6.5 volumes per capita. among other
    problems discussed are the assistance of the central regional
    library in vraca, centralisation of acquisition and
    cataloguing, discarding of obsolete literature and the most
    efficient use of financial allowances.</text>

    structure and development, staff/reader relations; (2)
    potential influence of employees on planning and introduction
    of computer systems; (3) employment and finance' will

    between different forms of information' facts; and information
    about information, such as particular books or subjects. to
    handle the stream of information, libraries need new

    can all information be accessible on-line to everyone. problems
    then arise of actually obtaining the information and selecting
    the amount needed. standardisation of cataloguing and systems
    is needed. the holdings of danish libraries should be

    available on-line to groups within politics, business, and

    indexing rules for chemistry, biology, and medicine. pascal
    deals with all aspects of chemistry within 2 subfiles whose
    combined yearly growth is about 100,000 references. indexing
    for chemistry uses 2 lexicons of controlled terms describing
    phenomena, processing, properties, methods, equipment, names of
    chemical reactions, and substructures or families of chemical
    compounds. a similar set of 2 vocabularies is used for biology
    and medicine. the form of the descriptors and the indexing is
    similar to that used throughout pascal in that indexing is
    accomplished to the most specific term within a hierarchical
    structure. specific indexing rules are provided in detail for
    subdivisions within the 3 disciplines. report not available

    <text>implementing clenshaw-curtis quadrature, ii computing the
    cosine transformation in a companion paper to this, "i
    methodology and experiences," the automatic clenshaw-curtis
    quadrature scheme was described and how each quadrature formula
    used in the scheme requires a cosine transformation of the
    integrand values was shown. the high cost of these cosine
    transformations has been a serious drawback in using
    clenshaw-curtis quadrature. two other problems related to the
    cosine transformation have also been trouble some. first, the
    conventional computation of the cosine transformation by
    recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly at
    the low frequencies which have the largest effect upon the
    integral. second, in case the automatic scheme should require
    refinement of the sampling, storage is required to save the
    integrand values after the cosine transformation is computed.
    this second part of the paper shows how the cosine
    transformation can be computed by a modification of the fast
    fourier transform and all three problems overcome. the
    modification is also applicable in other circumstances
    requiring cosine or sine transformations, such as polynomial
    interpolation through the chebyshev points. may, 1972

    bulgaria today are still an invaluable source of research.
    scholars when studying the lavish illuminations, find not only
    new information on the national literary and cultural history,
    but also on the arts. nowadays, the cyril and methodius
    national library in sofia proudly possesses the larger

    rilskij monastery national museum, the ivan vazov national
    library in plovdiv, the regional historic museum at veliko

    <text>centralisation and decentralisation' one point of view.
    examines the debate on centralisation and decentralisation in
    relation to' the historical aspects, showing how in general the
    latin american university system at present developed from the
    original european pattern; the institutional aspects, where the
    necessity for universities to fulfil their responsibilities
    dictates administrative structures, in turn governing library
    organisation; the technical-administrative aspects, outlining
    the essential characteristics of centralised, partially
    decentralised, and decentralised systems; and geographical
    factors. this survey leads to the conclusion that the
    particular circumstances of each particular case should
    determine administrative and organisational structures.</text>

    <text>law concerning the unified system of socio-economic

    the formation of a unified system of socio-economic

    mainly in regard to library statistics provided within the
    system. an in-depth analysis of the current state of library

    showed many shortcomings concerning statistical indexes and
    their definition. as a result a unified statistical system was

    produces a new path between two vertices already on paths. (the

    of vertices and e is the number of edges, each algorithm

    <text>the control of response times in multi-class systems by
    memory allocations the possibility of giving different quality
    of service to jobs of different classes by regulating their
    memory allocation is examined in the context of a paged
    computer system. two parameterized algorithms which partition
    the main memory between two classes of jobs are considered.
    initially, a closed system consisting of a process or and
    paging and file devices, with fixed numbers of jobs, is studied
    to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the
    proportion of processor time devoted to each class. applying a
    decomposition approach and treating the closed system as a
    single server, the response times in an open system with
    external arrivals are studied. the object is to investigate the
    effect of the memory alocation parameters on the expected
    response times under the two algorithms. numerical solutions
    and economical lower bounds for the expected response times as
    functions of the control parameters are obtained. a way of
    applying the results to systems with more than two job classes
    is indicated. july, 1979 hine, j.h. mitrani, i. tsur, s.

    of the public library as a linking agent to commercial data
    bases using the lockheed dialog information retrieval service.
    the service was free for the 1st year only. users were
    university students and researchers, professional people and
    librarians. provides a checklist of points to be observed in
    the planning phase. concludes that on-line services are a
    natural development in public libraries supplementing
    traditional reference services. describes another project
    involving 4 public libraries in england. the planned on-line
    service in lancashire (biros) was to be a service separate from
    the manual reference work. here too, staff was specially
    trained and the public, mainly from educational institutions,
    seemed willing to pay the necessary fees. a set of '
    guidelines' was prepared. finally, discusses atherton and
    christian's' 'librarians and online services', which examines
    how and why libraries make automated search systems available
    and stresses that these systems change the role of the
    reference librarian qualitatively from that of an archivist to

    <text>a lightpen-controlled program for on-line data analysis
    this paper describes a technique designed to ease the use of a
    data processing system by a person, in particular, a scientist,
    who is intimately and primarily concerned with interpreting the
    significance of data handled by the system. since such a person
    is often unable to spend the time necessary to master a
    programming language, it is essential that he be aided in
    composing commands to the computer. in the system described,
    the user is not required to learn or remember the vocabulary of
    the language because the vocabulary is displayed before him
    on"menus" by means of a computer-drive scope. he selects the
    various vocabulary elements required by pointing with the light
    pen. by use of a small unordered set of rewriting rules applied
    as a result of light pen selections, the user generates only
    syntactically correct commands to the system. he does not have
    to learn or remember the grammar. the program restricts the
    user severely in the particular language he can use, but the
    method for communicating with the program makes these
    restrictions seem quite natural and unconstraining. the program
    has been used successfully for over ten months. february, 1965

    the swedish situation of 2 separate data systems for special

    under-utilised resources, must be avoided in norway; the report
    is criticised for not considering computer development in
    public and special libraries together. it also fails to specify
    the effects of computerisation on library staffs, borrowers and
    finance. the committee regards issue control as the routine
    most requiring computerisation, but many public libraries have

    needs of these people. in order to offer them equal rights and
    equal opportunities as able persons in the library, several
    requirements for the physical lay-out and equipment should be

    <text>computer simulation-discussion of the technique and
    comparison of languages the purpose of this paper is to present
    a comparison of some computer simulation languages and of some
    of the involved in comparing software packages for digital
    computers are discussed in part i. the issue is obvious: users
    of digital computers must choose from available languages or
    write their own. substantial costs can occur, particularly in
    training, implementation and computer time if an inappropriate
    language is chosen.more and more computer simulation languages
    are being developed: comparisons and evaluations of existing
    languages are useful for designers and implementers as well as
    users. the second part is devoted to computer simulation and
    simulation languages. the computational characteristics of
    simulation are discussed with special attention being paid to a
    distinction between continuous and discrete change models. part
    iii presents a detailed comparison of six simulation languages
    and packages: simscript, clp, csl, gasp, cpss and sol. the
    characteristics of each are summarized in a series of tables.
    the implications of this analysis for designers of languages,
    for users, and for implementers are developed. the conclusion
    of the paper is that the packages now available for computer
    simulation offer features which none of the more
    general-purpose packages do and that analysis of strengths and
    weaknesses of each suggests ways in which both current and
    future simulation languages and packages can be improved.

    <text>production systems: or can we do better than bnf? since
    the development of bnf, the definition of the syntax of
    programming languages has been almost universally associated
    with context-free requirements. yet numerous interesting and
    difficult issues in syntax stem from the context-sensitive
    requirements, notably the compatibility between the declaration
    of an identifier and its uses, the correspondence between
    actual and formal parameters, and issues arising from block
    structure. this paper explores the use of a formal notation
    called production systems in providing a readable and complete
    formal definition of syntax. as a practical illustration, a
    small but significant subset of pl/i is considered. a more
    detailed presentation, as well as the application to define
    abstract syntax and translations between languages, is given in
    a previous paper by the author. february, 1974 ledgard, h. f.

    <text>a lattice model of secure information flow this paper
    investigates mechanisms that guarantee secure information flow
    in a computer system. these mechanisms are examined within a
    mathematical framework suitable for formulating the
    requirements of secure information flow among security classes.
    the central component of the model is a lattice structure
    derived from the security classes and justified by the
    semantics of information flow. the lattice properties permit
    concise formulations of the security requirements of different
    existing systems and facilitate the construction of mechanisms
    that enforce security. the model provides a unifying view of
    all systems that restrict information flow, enables a
    classification of them according to security objectives, and
    suggests some new approaches. it also leads to the construction
    of automatic program certification mechanisms for verifying the
    secure flow of information through a program. may, 1976

    for selecting the optimal set of tab stops for minimizing the
    number of characters transmitted. an implementation of the
    algorithm has reduced the number of characters transmitted by
    from 7 to 30 percent, but requires a prepass through the

    <text>a system of measuring the dynamics of reading. the

    <text>a model for masking rotational latency by dynamic disk
    allocation this paper presents the background and algorithms
    for masking the rotational latency of a disk or drum. it
    discusses the anticipatory input and output of blocks of data
    to buffer and primary memories for a mono-programmed computer
    system. a basic permutation algorithm and several variations
    are given. because of the anticipatory nature of the i/o
    scheduling, these algorithms are restricted to classes of
    programs with predictable behavior. while the methods are not
    restricted to numerical computations, matrix and partial
    differential equation methods are typical examples of their
    use. it is shown that latency may be masked using a small
    amount of buffer memory. the methods discussed are independent
    of the overall size of the data base being considered. may,

    royal library, to which 19 publishers agreed to submit details
    of new books in preparation. from information supplied
    catalogue entries were prepared and forwarded to the publishers
    for inclusion in the appropriate books. at the end of the study
    a questionnaire was circulated to the publishers who had
    participated in the scheme, together with 21 academic libraries
    and 26 booksellers in the netherlands. almost all concerned
    felt that the experiment had been a success. however, the

    the central library of medicine in cologne increased by nearly
    400% to 210,000. since computerised information services
    expanded considerably during this period, the library needed
    detailed information on requested material for future planning,
    so in 1978 a survey was carried out with the help of the
    deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german research association).
    information from 12 libraries was obtained on the sources of
    ordered literature, the use of material by different
    professional groups, the use of computer services,
    bibliographies and abstracts, the types and language of
    material required and the type of library making the request.
    the survey's central finding was that the activities of the
    computerised information services considerably influenced user
    demand. libraries must cater for this and their financing

    <text>experimental personalized array translator system a
    system designed for intimate man-machine interaction in a
    general-purpose problem-solving environment is experimentally
    operational. the system utilizers an array-oriented symbolic
    source language containing powerful statement types. these
    include numeric, boolean, relational and selection operators on
    operands which can be entire arrays. the system also permits
    simple specification of test and argument arrays in single
    statements. the completely symbolic operating system includes
    display and entry of program and data. sequence control is
    aided by an interrupt switch which allows the user to interact
    with the program during execution. in addition to normal stored
    program sequencing, the system provides trace options and the
    ability to enter any statement for immediate execution. present
    implementation of the system is with an interpretive translator
    on an ibm 1620 computer. july, 1964 hellerman, h. ca640714 jb

    <text>retrieval of misspelled names in an airlines passenger
    record system this paper discusses the limited problem of
    recognition and retrieval of a given misspelled name from among
    a roster of several hundred names, such as the reservation
    inventory for a given flight of a large jet airliner. a program
    has been developed and operated on the telefile (a
    stored-program core and drum memory solid-state computer) which
    will retrieve passengers' records successfully, despite
    significant misspellings either at original entry time or at
    retrieval time. the procedure involves an automatic scoring
    technique which matches the names in a condensed form. only
    those few names most closely resembling the requested name,
    with their phone numbers annexed, are presented for the agents
    final manual selecton. the program has successfully isolated
    and retrieved names which were subjected to a number of unusual
    (as well as usual) misspellings. march, 1962 davidson, l.

    <text>signature simulation and certain cryptographic codes
    three cyphers allegedly authored by thomas jefferson beale in
    1822 have been the subject of intensive study for over 100
    years. generations of cryptanalysts have expended untold
    man-years, thus far without success, attempting tode code them;
    vast armies of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have
    devoted herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills of
    virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. the history of
    pertinent activities would fill volumes, yet serious students
    of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the
    cyphers' authenticity. it has been alleged that the "known
    solution" to cypher number two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52,
    49,...("i have deposited in the county of bedford about four
    miles from buford's in an excavation or vault...") with the aid
    of an unsanitized version of the declaration of independence
    was merely a superb, imaginative, and grandiose hoax
    perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons. modern computer
    technology could obviously perform signature analyses the
    process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
    insights into their construction. for the benefit of the
    uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second cypher
    employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered
    consecutively, and first letters of these words are sought out
    at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at
    random to match the letters of the clear text or message. the
    sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches is then
    written down as the final code. while primitive, the process
    has the advantage of relative security until the source
    document becomes known; at that moment the cypher can be
    decoded even by second graders. the work now completed with the
    help of our univac 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of
    the beale cyphers and various types of simulations. for
    example, we have turned the entire process of simulated
    encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed
    the signatures of these synthetic codes; we have also encoded
    various messages by hand, using different texts and a variety
    of methods to obtain their signatures. these simulations
    provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both
    process and data dependent; they indicate also very strongly
    that mr. beale's cyphers are for real and that it is merely a
    matter of time before someone finds the correct source document
    and locates the right vault in the common-wealth of virginia.

    recent discussion suggest that in many circumstances it is to

    trees. a drawback of the technique as hitherto presented is its
    liability to produce object programs of longer run time than
    necessary. in this paper a modification of the technique is
    discussed which takes into account both rule frequencies and
    the relative times for evaluating conditions. this can

    management is proposed. the proposed addendum is to include in
    the curriculum a course on information systems administration.
    it is important for two reasons: (1) the systems designer must
    understand the administrative framework in which he must
    operate to work effectively, and (2) an important objective of
    the curriculum recommendations is to prepare the future manager
    of the computer activity. it is felt that the importance of

    representation and function definition to the iteration
    statement, the most important poin t of interaction between
    data and the control structure of the language itself. a means
    of specializing alphard's loops to operate on abstract entities
    without explicit dependence on the representation of those
    entities is in troduced. specification and verification
    techniques that allow the properties of the generators for such
    iterations to be expressed in the form of proof rules are
    developed. results are obtained that for common special cases
    of these loops are essentially identical to the corresponding
    constructs in other languages. a means of showing that a

    <text>teaching "about programming" this paper presents the
    goals and organization of a course about programming designed
    to provide entering students in a graduate program with a
    cultural enrichment in their professional lives. the students
    are expected to have taken at least two programming courses
    prior to this one and, therefore, to be familiar with at least
    two programming languages, both as students and users. teaching
    someone how to program is similar to teaching him to play a
    musical instrument: neither skill can be taught-they must be
    learned. however, the teacher still serves several vital
    purposes: to present a set of rules for producing well-formed
    utterances; to offer numerous demonstrations of his own skill;
    and to function as an involved critic. finally, the teacher is
    the source of information about the process in which the
    student is involved. july, 1973 rosin, r. f. education,

    <text>an analysis of algorithms for the dutch national flag
    problem solutions to the dutch national flag problem have been
    given by dijkstra [1] and meyer [3]. dijkstra starts with a
    simple program and arrives at an improved program by
    refinement. both of the algorithms given by dijkstra are shown
    to have an expected number of swaps which is 2/3n + 0(1) and
    that these values differ at most by 1/3 of a swap and
    asymptotically by 1/4 of a swap. the algorithm of meyer is
    shown to have expected swap complexity 5/9n. october, 1978

    <text>some aspects of technical report processing by federal
    agencies. technical reports are a valuable resource of
    scientific and technical information which has been allowed to
    slip into less than maximum utility. while the processing of
    more traditional information sources has progressed and
    remarkably improved through such mechanisms as shared
    cataloguing and on-line access to huge files of cataloguing
    data, the corresponding processing of technical reports has
    remained relatively stagnant. some efforts at coordinating the
    processing of reports have been made by the 4 us federal
    agencies responsible for the largest report collections.
    additional efforts suggested include study of a common report
    format, more extensive shared processing of federal documents
    and increased efforts towards cooperation in the federal
    library network.</text>

    new algorithms for the perception of rings, aromaticity, and
    tautomers were developed in conjunction with the cameo program
    for computer-assisted mechanistic evaluation of organic
    reactions. a noteworthy aspect of the ring algorithm is that
    only rings belonging to the smallest set of smallest rings are
    found. results for representative molecules are presented, and
    rules for determining the aromaticity/tautomer status of rings,
    especially heterocycles, are discussed.</text>

    <text>the augmented predictive analyzer for context-free
    languages-its relative efficiency it has been proven by
    greibach that for a given context-free grammar g, a
    standard-form grammar gs can be constructed, which generates
    the same languages as is generated by g and whose rules are all
    of the form z --&gt; cy(1) ... y(m), (m &gt;= o) where z and
    y(i) are intermediate symbols and c a terminal symbol. since
    the predictive analyzer at harvard uses a standard-form
    grammar, it can accept the language of any context-free grammar
    g, given an equivalent standard-form grammar gs. the structural
    descriptions sd(gs,x) assigned to a given sentence x by the
    predictive analyzer, however, are usually different from the
    structural descriptions sd(g,x) assigned to the same sentence
    by the original context-free grammar g from which gs is
    derived. in section 1, an algorithm, originally due to abbott
    is described standard-form grammar each of whose rules is in
    standard form, supplemented by additional information
    describing its derivation from the original context-free
    grammar. a technique for performing the sd(gs,x) to sd(g,x)
    transformation effectively is also described. in section 2, the
    augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing algorithm for
    arbitrary context-free languages is compared with two other
    parsing algorithms: a selective top-to-bottom algorithm similar
    to irons' "error correcting parse algorithm" and an immediate
    constituent analyzer which is an extension of sakai-cocke's
    algorithm for normal grammars. the comparison is based upon
    several criteria of efficiency, covering core-storage
    requirements, complexities of the programs and processing time.

    <text>popin: an international information network for the

    international population information network (popin) is being
    established in response to the increasing recognition of the
    value of such information, the desire of developing countries
    to build their own information infrastructure, and the need to
    tie together isolated activities to maximise benefits. it is
    developing as a regional and national operation with activities
    integrated through a central coordinating unit. the 1st meeting
    of the popin advisory group (scheduled for early 1980) was to
    discuss ways of improving interconnections among existing
    population information systems; resolve problems of
    standardisation, uniformity, and coordination; and reach a
    consensus on the network's operation.</text>

    <text>scheduling university course examinations by computer a
    new approach to the problem of scheduling course examinations
    is presented. in principle, an examination schedule which
    requires a minimum number of examination periods and satisfies
    the constraint that no student be required to take two
    examinations simultaneously can be found in two steps. first,
    course which may have their examinations scheduled at the same
    period are grouped together in all possible ways. then a
    minimum number of these groups, such that each course is
    included at least once, are selected. by removing multiple
    occurrences of courses and then scheduling each group at a
    different period a minimal schedule can be obtained. known
    algorithms for carrying out these procedures are prohibitively
    expensive. approximations to the ideal procedure outlined above
    are given which yield nonminimal but feasible schedules with a
    very small expenditure of time. results of experiments using
    these techniques are given. these are encouraging and indicate
    that further experimentation would be worthwhile. april, 1967

    the computer an updated file of their current knowledge, and on
    selecting a paper to read, they can obtain from the computer
    the minimum subtree of theorems required to bring them from
    what they already know to the background knowledge which the
    paper assumes. under certain conditions, means are also
    provided for the contribution of useful comments by the readers
    of a work and for interaction between commentators and with the
    author. this paper describes how the system can be organized
    and the role required of readers, writers, and commentators.

    used to define other words. such relations as class inclusion,
    possession, and active or passive actions are used as
    definitional material. the resulting structure serves as a
    powerful vehicle for research on the logic of question
    answering. examples of methods of inputting information and

    conclusion is that, although lisp and other list processing
    languages are ideally suited for producing complex associative
    structures, they are inadequate vehicles for language
    processing on any large scale-at east until they can use
    auxiliary memory as a continuous extension of core memory.

    <text>wake up, holger danske (and lise ostergaard). discusses
    the production of a danish encyclopaedia. the publishers,
    gyldendal, hoped to produce an updated version of the esteemed
    salmonsen, but the project proved too expensive and a less
    ambitious 10 volume work has now been published. a similar lack
    of a substantial national encyclopaedia led in sweden to the
    appointment of a committee by the ministry of education, whose
    report is discussed here. it analyses all problems surrounding
    the publication of encyclopaedias and concludes that such
    publication can today only by undertaken with state support. it
    stresses the need for a large encyclopaedia for the acquisition
    of background information. use will be mainly in connection
    with education, in administration and industry, and will be
    central in library reference sections. guidelines for the
    cooperation between publishers and the state are drawn up, and
    a publishing timetable of at most 10 years with updating every
    10 years is suggested. pub lication as teledata or on video

    <text>french libraries and their national heritage. paper
    presented by the french honorary inspector general of libraries
    at a librarians' study day, feb 80, marking heritage year in
    france. considers the nature of france's library heritage, and
    gives examples of the notable buildings and interiors which
    must be included with france's outstanding library collections
    of books, documents, maps, coins, and other objects of value.
    discussion of collections covers 4 main topics' conservation,
    exploitation, enrichment, and transmission. the librarian's
    responsibilities in relation to each are considered, with
    particular reference to the problems of conservation. current
    procedures are surveyed and a comprehensive policy suggested,
    focusing on bibliotheque nationale activities and recent
    research on new techniques. details are given of existing
    catalogues and projects for facilitating exploitation. in
    conclusion the immense value of france's library heritage is

    <text>a critical commentary on leimkuhler's 'exact' formulation
    of the bradford law. argues that powerful operational research
    techniques operate only on a small fraction of the statistical
    information usually provided by the social sciences. uses the
    argument to illustrate leimkuhler's recent claim to have found
    an 'exact' fit to bradford's law. an elementary theorem of
    shannon information theory shows that his new function is
    applied to only 2.3% of the statistical information inherent in
    the bibliography he chooses and that bradford's original simple
    formulation not only fits this segment but also the whole
    bibliography more closely than the new formulation. as every
    statistical information loss can be measured, it can be shown
    that sophisticated mathematical techniques cannot compensate
    for the information they squander.</text>

    <text>strategies for improving utilization of computerized
    statistical data by the social scientific community. in recent
    decades there has been a notable expansion of statistical data
    produced by the public and private sectors for administrative,
    research, policy and evaluation programmes. this is due to
    advances in relatively inexpensive and efficient data
    collection and management of computer-readable statistical
    data. corresponding changes have not occurred in the management
    of data collection, preservation, description and
    dissemination. as a result, the process by which data become
    accessible to social researchers and others is frustrating,
    time consuming, and inefficient. describes the reasons for this
    situation' the problem-solving workstyle of social data users,
    the nature of the data and their relationship to computer

    <text>indispensible considerations in automating library
    techniques. libraries, despite their tradition-minded
    reputation, always were sensible about the technical aspects of
    their duties and open to innovations. consequently the
    application of computer techniques here is discussed. these
    systems usually are not developed on unique principles for
    library purposes, but have been adapted from principles already
    existing in other applications. some of these principles are
    more apt for application in libraries than others regarding the
    special duties of libraries towards their users. this fact
    today seems to be slightly underrated when libraries decide
    about the acquisition of an automated system.</text>

    <text>an assembly language for reprogramming complete
    reprogramming of compiler language programs is seldom
    necessary. it is assembly language programs which present the
    greatest difficulty. assembly languages generally provide a
    one-for-one translation from a symbolic to a numeric version of
    a program, that is, from assembly language to machine language.
    the meta-language presented here can be used to specify the
    mapping of any language which conforms to a canonical list form
    into an arbitrary stream of bits. this bit stream may be
    treated as a machine language program, a character stream, or
    whatever else the user might desire. thus, this meta-language
    can be used to map from one assembly language into another or
    from the assembly language for one machine into the machine
    language of another. december, 1965 graham, m. l. ingerman, p.

    both accidentally and intentionally caused losses. although the
    nomenclature for business crimes remains the same as for manual
    depository and other financial service systems - for example,
    fraud, theft, embezzlement - the characteristics of the crimes
    are new. the changes resulting from the accelerating use of
    efts and its continual technological advances broaden the scope
    of security issues to be examined. factors such as backup
    requirements, regulatory and legislative actions, and economics
    give rise to the urgency for immediate research into solutions
    for emerging efts - related vulnerabilities. december, 1979

    at a semantical level due to a suitable extension of the given

    machines. with every turing machine provided with a two-way
    half-tape, there is associated a similar machine, doing
    essentially the same job, but working on a tape obtained from
    the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares. the new
    machine belongs to the family, elsewhere introduced, generated
    by composition and iteration from the two machines l and r.

    <text>changing concepts of the role and objectives of the
    public library in palestine, as exemplified by the sha'ar zion
    library in jaffa and tel-aviv (in hebrew). traces the evolving
    conceptions of the role and objectives of the sha'ar zion
    public library as formulated by its founders, librarians and
    the town fathers during the period of the 1st 4 waves of
    zionist immigration, from the 1880s to 1931. the emphasis is on
    analysis of the clash between the concept of the popular public
    library, whose primary purpose was to serve predominantly the
    immediate and topical needs of the immigrants and help in their
    absorption, and the concept of the scholarly public library,
    which emphasises the provision of services to a limited
    clientele of scholars, writers and teachers in the field of
    jewish studies. opens with a description of the social
    background of the period. the 2nd part deals with the origins
    of the sha'ar zion library and the contribution of voluntary
    organisations such as the b'nai brith and b'nai moshe orders
    towards the formulation of its mission. the 3rd and 4th
    sections analyse the deliberations and contentions of members
    of the town council and of advisors with regard to library
    objectives during the period of the 3rd and 4th waves of
    immigration (1919-31). in the last section, attempts to draw
    some conclusions with regard to the role played by the public
    library in palestine in the process of realisation of zionist
    ideology, especially its function as an agency for educating
    the populace in the spirit of that ideology, and in realising
    the ideal of the creation of a new jewish society in palestine
    which would preserve and maintain its cultural excellence and
    supremacy.</text>

    differences between primary, secondary and tertiary information
    are outlined. according to whether the symbol is a reflection
    of phenomena or a reflection of a symbol (sign), various orders
    of the reflection are recognised, i.e. the order of the symbol
    reflection. thus primary information is a reflection of a
    phenomenon deposited without a sign/mark, secondary information
    is a reflection of the deposited signs, etc. the statement

    the process of gradual understanding of information which

    <text>context-sensitive parsing this paper presents a canonical
    form for context-sensitive derivations and a parsing algorithm
    which finds each context-sensitive analysis once and only once.
    the amount of memory required by the algorithm is essentially
    no more than the required to store a single complete
    derivation. in addition, a modified version of the basic
    algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for
    grammars which contain loops. the algorithm is also compared
    with several previous parsers for context-sensitive grammars
    and general rewriting systems, and the difference between the
    two types of analyses is discussed. the algorithm appears to be
    complementary to an algorithm by s. kuno in several respects,
    including the space-time trade-off and the degree of context
    dependence involved. july, 1970 woods, w. a. context-sensitive

    <text>approximation of polygonal maps by cellular maps the
    approximation of polygonal thematic maps by cellular maps, an
    important operation in geographical data processing, is
    analyzed. the data organization used for representing the
    polygonal maps is a widely used segment-based data structure,
    where class labels identify the regions bordering each segment
    on either side. the approximation algorithm presented operates
    on such an organization, eliminating the need for the
    recognition of region boundaries. each segment is examined only
    once. the versatility of the new organization is further
    illustrated by the outline of algorithms for area computation
    and point inclusion. the algorithm is applied to a set of soil

    <text>do not tear down what has so successfully been built up.
    reports the speech by the danish library association's
    chairman, karl johan mortensen, to the meeting of the
    kommunernes landsforening (national association of local
    authorities), where the question had earlier been raised of how
    culture could be disseminated to larger circles. it was argued
    that expansion of library activities was not enough to reach
    those unfamiliar with libraries. the institutional framework
    had prevented genuine decentralisation and popularisation of
    culture. libraries with rigid management and demand for
    qualified staff were preventing their use as local culture
    centres. solutions involving greater coordination with other
    local activities were offered. against this mortensen argues
    that the 1964 library act promoted decentralisation and that
    libraries more than other institutions are reaching the broad
    population. warns against reduction of library activities in
    order to help the grass roots movements. local aut horities
    need the support of the state for library services. the debate
    that followed and the reply from the national association's
    chairman stressed that libraries were not under attack.</text>

    which normal functioning is impaired. it is essential that all
    students be given the same consideration and respect regardless
    of individual differences. librarians can contribute most by
    understanding the special difficulties and needs of the child.
    abilities rather than disabilities need to be emphasised.
    besides psychological and social barriers, the problem of
    simple physical access must be considered. design features that
    must be considered include access to the building, access
    within the library and access to all library services.</text>

    <text>a commission with possibilities-in spite of all.
    discusses the functions of the public library commission
    (folkbiblioteksutredningen) in sweden after 1 year's work.
    suggests that the commission should formulate not only
    cultural, but also social and educational goals for public
    libraries. it should indicate ways in which libraries in
    cooperation with schools and adult education organisations can
    save the book at a time when aural and visual media threaten to
    take over. to this end the commission has begun to cooperate
    with the cultural council's planned literature campaign in the
    kopparberg region. the commission can contribute to the
    equalisation of services by placing more emphasis on the
    regional library's role in this respect. any extra money should
    be channelled through the regional library.</text>

    be effective only if it applies its resources towards meeting
    the cultural needs of the whole community. south africa in the
    main lacks research on community needs relevant to library
    services. research on the non-user in the uk, the usa and south
